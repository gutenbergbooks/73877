<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Dear Grote</span>,</p>

<p class='c007'>I dedicate to you this edition of
the Works of Hobbes; first, because I know
you will be well pleased to see a complete
collection of all the writings of an Author
for whom you have so high an admiration.
Secondly, because I am indebted to you for
my first acquaintance with the speculations of
one of the greatest and most original thinkers
in the English language, whose works, I have
often heard you regret, were so scarce, and so
much less read and studied than they deserved
to be. It now, therefore, gives me great satisfaction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_I'>I</span>to be able to gratify a wish, you have frequently
expressed, that some person, who had
time and due reverence for that illustrious
man, would undertake to edite his works, and
bring his views again before his countrymen,
who have so long and so unjustly neglected

<p class='c006'>If, when I had finished my translation of this first section of
the Elements of Philosophy, I had presently committed the
same to the press, it might have come to your hands sooner
than now it doth. But as I undertook it with much diffidence
of my own ability to perform it well; so I thought fit, before
I published it, to pray Mr. Hobbes to view, correct, and order
it according to his own mind and pleasure. Wherefore, though
you find some places enlarged, others altered, and two chapters,
<span class='fss'>XVIII</span> and <span class='fss'>XX</span>, almost wholly changed, you may nevertheless
remain assured, that as now I present it to you, it doth not at
all vary from the author's own sense and meaning. As for
the Six Lessons to the Savilian Professors at Oxford, they are
not of my translation, but were written, as here you have
them in English, by Mr. Hobbes himself; and are joined to
this book, because they are chiefly in defence of the same.<a id='rA'></a><a href='#fA' class='c008'><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This first section of the Elements of Philosophy, the
monument of my service and your Lordship's bounty,
though, after the Third Section published, long deferred,
yet at last finished, I now present, my most
excellent Lord, and dedicate to your Lordship. A
little book, but full; and great enough, if men count
well for great; and to an attentive reader versed in
the demonstrations of mathematicians, that is, to
your Lordship, clear and easy to understand, and
almost new throughout, without any offensive novelty.
I know that that part of philosophy, wherein are
considered lines and figures, has been delivered to
us notably improved by the ancients; and withal a
most perfect pattern of the logic by which they were
enabled to find out and demonstrate such excellent
theorems as they have done. I know also that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>hypothesis of the earth's diurnal motion was the
invention of the ancients; but that both it, and
astronomy, that is, celestial physics, springing up
together with it, were by succeeding philosophers
strangled with the snares of words. And therefore
the beginning of astronomy, except observations, I
think is not to be derived from farther time than from
Nicolaus Copernicus; who in the age next preceding
the present revived the opinion of Pythagoras, Aristarchus,
and Philolaus. After him, the doctrine of
the motion of the earth being now received, and a difficult
question thereupon arising concerning the descent
of heavy bodies, Galileus in our time, striving
with that difficulty, was the first that opened to us the
gate of natural philosophy universal, which is the
knowledge of the nature of <em>motion</em>. So that neither can
the age of natural philosophy be reckoned higher than
to him. Lastly, the science of <i>man's body</i>, the most
profitable part of natural science, was first discovered
with admirable sagacity by our countryman Doctor
Harvey, principal Physician to King James and King
Charles, in his books of the <cite>Motion of the Blood</cite>,
and of the <cite>Generation of Living Creatures</cite>; who is
the only man I know, that conquering envy, hath
established a new doctrine in his life-time. Before
these, there was nothing certain in natural philosophy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>but every man's experiments to himself, and the
natural histories, if they may be called certain, that
are no certainer than civil histories. But since these,
astronomy and natural philosophy in general have,
for so little time, been extraordinarily advanced by
Joannes Keplerus, Petrus Gassendus, and Marinus
Mersennus; and the science of human bodies in
special by the wit and industry of physicians, the
only true natural philosophers, especially of our most
learned men of the College of Physicians in London.
Natural Philosophy is therefore but young; but
Civil Philosophy yet much younger, as being no older
(I say it provoked, and that my detractors may know
how little they have wrought upon me) than my own
book <span lang="la"><cite>De Cive</cite></span>. But what? were there no philosophers
natural nor civil among the ancient Greeks?
There were men so called; witness Lucian, by whom
they are derided; witness divers cities, from which
they have been often by public edicts banished. But
it follows not that there was <em>philosophy</em>. There
walked in old Greece a certain phantasm, for superficial
gravity, though full within of fraud and filth, a
little like philosophy; which unwary men, thinking
to be it, adhered to the professors of it, some to one,
some to another, though they disagreed among themselves,
and with great salary put their children to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>them to be taught, instead of wisdom, nothing but
to dispute, and, neglecting the laws, to determine
every question according to their own fancies. The
first doctors of the Church, next the Apostles, born
in those times, whilst they endeavoured to defend
the Christian faith against the Gentiles by natural
reason, began also to make use of philosophy, and
with the decrees of Holy Scripture to mingle the
sentences of heathen philosophers; and first some
harmless ones of Plato, but afterwards also many
foolish and false ones out of the physics and metaphysics
of Aristotle; and bringing in the enemies,
betrayed unto them the citadel of Christianity. From
that time, instead of the worship of God, there entered
a thing called <em>school divinity</em>, walking on one foot
firmly, which is the Holy Scripture, but halted on
the other rotten foot, which the Apostle Paul called
<em>vain</em>, and might have called <em>pernicious philosophy</em>;
for it hath raised an infinite number of controversies
in the Christian world concerning religion, and from
those controversies, wars. It is like that <i>Empusa</i> in
the Athenian comic poet, which was taken in Athens
for a ghost that changed shapes, having one brazen
leg, but the other was the leg of an ass, and was sent,
as was believed, by Hecate, as a sign of some approaching
evil fortune. Against this <i>Empusa</i> I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>there cannot be invented a better exorcism, than to
distinguish between the rules of religion, that is, the
rules of honouring God, which we have from the
laws, and the rules of philosophy, that is, the opinions
of private men; and to yield what is due to
religion to the Holy Scripture, and what is due to
philosophy to natural reason. And this I shall do,
if I but handle the Elements of Philosophy truly and
clearly, as I endeavour to do. Therefore having in
the Third Section, which I have published and dedicated
to your Lordship, long since reduced all power
ecclesiastical and civil by strong arguments of reason,
without repugnance to God's word, to one and the
same sovereign authority; I intend now, by putting
into a clear method the true foundations of natural
philosophy, to fright and drive away this metaphysical
<i>Empusa</i>; not by skirmish, but by letting in the
light upon her. For I am confident, if any confidence
of a writing can proceed from the writer's
fear, circumspection, and diffidence, that in the
three former parts of this book all that I have said
is sufficiently demonstrated from definitions; and all
in the fourth part from suppositions not absurd.
But if there appear to your Lordship anything less
fully demonstrated than to satisfy every reader, the
cause was this, that I professed to write not all to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>all, but some things to geometricians only. But that
your Lordship will be satisfied, I cannot doubt.</p>

<p class='c001'>There remains the second section, which is concerning
<em>Man</em>. That part thereof, where I handle the
<em>Optics</em>, containing six chapters, together with the
tables of the figures belonging to them, I have already
written and engraven lying by me above these six
years. The rest shall, as soon as I can, be added to
it; though by the contumelies and petty injuries of
some unskilful men, I know already, by experience,
how much greater thanks will be due than paid me,
for telling men the truth of what men are. But the
burthen I have taken on me I mean to carry through;
not striving to appease, but rather to revenge myself
of envy, by encreasing it. For it contents me that
I have your Lordship's favour, which, being all you
require, I acknowledge; and for which, with my
prayers to Almighty God for your Lordship's safety,
I shall, to my power, be always thankful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Think not, Courteous Reader, that the philosophy, the
elements whereof I am going to set in order, is that which
makes philosophers' stones, nor that which is found in the
metaphysic codes; but that it is the natural reason of man,
busily flying up and down among the creatures, and bringing
back a true report of their order, causes and effects. Philosophy,
therefore, the child of the world and your own mind,
is within yourself; perhaps not fashioned yet, but like the
world its father, as it was in the beginning, a thing confused.
Do, therefore, as the statuaries do, who, by hewing off that
which is superfluous, do not make but find the image. Or imitate
the creation: if you will be a philosopher in good earnest,
let your reason move upon the deep of your own cogitations
and experience; those things that lie in confusion must be set
asunder, distinguished, and every one stamped with its own
name set in order; that is to say, your method must resemble
that of the creation. The order of the creation was,
<em>light</em>, <em>distinction of day and night</em>, the <em>firmament</em>, the <em>luminaries</em>,
<em>sensible creatures</em>, <em>man</em>; and, after the creation, the
<em>commandment</em>. Therefore the order of contemplation will
be, <em>reason</em>, <em>definition</em>, <em>space</em>, the <em>stars</em>, <em>sensible quality</em>,
<em>man</em>; and after man is grown up, <em>subjection to command</em>.
In the first part of this section, which is entitled Logic, I set
up the light of reason. In the second, which hath for title
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>the Grounds of Philosophy, I distinguish the most common
notions by accurate definition, for the avoiding of confusion
and obscurity. The third part concerns the expansion of
space, that is Geometry. The fourth contains the Motion of
the Stars, together with the doctrine of sensible qualities.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the second section, if it please God, shall be handled
<em>Man</em>. In the third section, the doctrine of <em>Subjection</em> is handled
already. This is the method I followed; and if it like you,
you may use the same; for I do but propound, not commend
to you anything of mine. But whatsoever shall be the
method you will like, I would very fain commend philosophy
to you, that is to say, the study of wisdom, for want of which
we have all suffered much damage lately. For even they, that
study wealth, do it out of love to wisdom; for their treasures
serve them but for a looking-glass, wherein to behold and
contemplate their own wisdom. Nor do they, that love to be
employed in public business, aim at anything but place
wherein to show their wisdom. Neither do voluptuous men
neglect philosophy, but only because they know not how great
a pleasure it is to the mind of man to be ravished in the
vigorous and perpetual embraces of the most beauteous world.
Lastly, though for nothing else, yet because the mind of man
is no less impatient of empty time than nature is of empty
place, to the end you be not forced for want of what to do, to
be troublesome to men that have business, or take hurt by
falling into idle company, but have somewhat of your own
wherewith to fill up your time, I recommend unto you to
study philosophy. Farewell.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art1.1'></a>Philosophy seems to me to be amongst men now,
in the same manner as corn and wine are said to
have been in the world in ancient time. For from
the beginning there were vines and ears of corn
growing here and there in the fields; but no care
was taken for the planting and sowing of them.
Men lived therefore upon acorns; or if any were
so bold as to venture upon the eating of those
unknown and doubtful fruits, they did it with danger
of their health. In like manner, every man
brought Philosophy, that is, Natural Reason, into
the world with him; for all men can reason to
some degree, and concerning some things: but
where there is need of a long series of reasons,
there most men wander out of the way, and fall
into error for want of method, as it were for want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of sowing and planting, that is, of improving their
reason. And from hence it comes to pass, that
they who content themselves with daily experience,
which may be likened to feeding upon acorns, and
either reject, or not much regard philosophy, are
commonly esteemed, and are, indeed, men of
sounder judgment than those who, from opinions,
though not vulgar, yet full of uncertainty, and
carelessly received, do nothing but dispute and
wrangle, like men that are not well in their wits.
I confess, indeed, that that part of philosophy by
which magnitudes and figures are computed, is
highly improved. But because I have not observed
the like advancement in the other parts of it, my
purpose is, as far forth as I am able, to lay open
the few and first Elements of Philosophy in general,
as so many seeds from which pure and true
Philosophy may hereafter spring up by little and
little.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am not ignorant how hard a thing it is to
weed out of men's minds such inveterate opinions
as have taken root there, and been confirmed in
them by the authority of most eloquent writers;
especially seeing true (that is, accurate) Philosophy
professedly rejects not only the paint and false
colours of language, but even the very ornaments
and graces of the same; and the first grounds of
all science are not only not beautiful, but poor,
arid, and, in appearance, deformed. Nevertheless,
there being certainly some men, though but few,
who are delighted with truth and strength of reason
in all things, I thought I might do well to take
this pains for the sake even of those few. I proceed
therefore to the matter, and take my beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>from the very definition of philosophy, which is
this.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Definition of Philosophy explained.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art1.2'></a>2. <span class='sc'>Philosophy</span> <i>is such knowledge of effects or
appearances, as we acquire by true ratiocination
from the knowledge we have first of their causes
or generation; And again, of such causes or generations
as may be from knowing first their effects</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the better understanding of which definition,
we must consider, first, that although Sense and
Memory of things, which are common to man and
all living creatures, be knowledge, yet because they
are given us immediately by nature, and not gotten
by ratiocination, they are not philosophy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, seeing Experience is nothing but memory;
and Prudence, or prospect into the future
time, nothing but expectation of such things as
we have already had experience of, Prudence also
is not to be esteemed philosophy.</p>

<p class='c001'>By <span class='fss'>RATIOCINATION</span>, I mean <em>computation</em>. Now
to compute, is either to collect the sum of many
things that are added together, or to know what
remains when one thing is taken out of another.
<em>Ratiocination</em>, therefore, is the same with <em>addition</em>
and <em>substraction</em>; and if any man add <em>multiplication</em>
and <em>division</em>, I will not be against it, seeing
multiplication is nothing but addition of equals one
to another, and division nothing but a substraction
of equals one from another, as often as is possible.
So that all ratiocination is comprehended in these
two operations of the mind, addition and substraction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ratiocination of the Mind.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art1.3'></a>3. But how by the <em>ratiocination</em> of our mind,
we add and substract in our silent thoughts, without
the use of words, it will be necessary for me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>to make intelligible by an example or two. If
therefore a man see something afar off and obscurely,
although no appellation had yet been given
to anything, he will, notwithstanding, have the
same idea of that thing for which now, by imposing
a name on it, we call it <em>body</em>. Again, when,
by coming nearer, he sees the same thing thus and
thus, now in one place and now in another, he
will have a new idea thereof, namely, that for
which we now call such a thing <em>animated</em>. Thirdly,
when standing nearer, he perceives the figure,
hears the voice, and sees other things which are
signs of a rational mind, he has a third idea,
though it have yet no appellation, namely, that for
which we now call anything <em>rational</em>. Lastly,
when, by looking fully and distinctly upon it, he
conceives all that he has seen as one thing, the
idea he has now is compounded of his former ideas,
which are put together in the mind in the same
order in which these three single names, <em>body</em>,
<em>animated</em>, <em>rational</em>, are in speech compounded into
this one name, <em>body-animated-rational</em>, or <em>man</em>.
In like manner, of the several conceptions of <em>four
sides, equality of sides, and right angles</em>, is compounded
the conception of a <em>square</em>. For the
mind may conceive a figure of four sides without
any conception of their equality, and of that equality
without conceiving a right angle; and may
join together all these single conceptions into one
conception or one idea of a square. And thus we
see how the conceptions of the mind are compounded.
Again, whosoever sees a man standing
near him, conceives the whole idea of that man;
and if, as he goes away, he follow him with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>eyes only, he will lose the idea of those things
which were signs of his being rational, whilst,
nevertheless, the idea of a body-animated remains
still before his eyes, so that the idea of rational is
substracted from the whole idea of man, that is to
say, of body-animated-rational, and there remains
that of body-animated; and a while after, at a
greater distance, the idea of animated will be lost,
and that of body only will remain; so that at last,
when nothing at all can be seen, the whole idea
will vanish out of sight. By which examples, I
think, it is manifest enough what is the internal
ratiocination of the mind without words.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must not therefore think that computation,
that is, ratiocination, has place only in numbers,
as if man were distinguished from other living
creatures (which is said to have been the opinion
of <em>Pythagoras</em>) by nothing but the faculty of numbering;
for <em>magnitude, body, motion, time, degrees
of quality, action, conception, proportion, speech
and names</em> (in which all the kinds of philosophy
consist) are capable of addition and substraction.
Now such things as we add or substract, that is,
which we put into an account, we are said to <em>consider</em>,
in Greek λογίζεσθαι, in which language also
συλλογίζεσθαι signifies to <em>compute</em>, <em>reason</em>, or <em>reckon</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Properties, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art1.4'></a>4. But <em>effects</em> and the <em>appearances</em> of things to
sense, are faculties or powers of bodies, which
make us distinguish them from one another; that
is to say, conceive one body to be equal or unequal,
like or unlike to another body; as in the
example above, when by coming near enough to
any body, we perceive the motion and going of
the same, we distinguish it thereby from a tree, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>column, and other fixed bodies; and so that motion
or going is the <em>property</em> thereof, as being proper
to living creatures, and a faculty by which they
make us distinguish them from other bodies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How Properties are known by Generation, and contrarily.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art1.5'></a>5. How the knowledge of any effect may be
gotten from the knowledge of the generation
thereof, may easily be understood by the example
of a circle: for if there be set before us a plain
figure, having, as near as may be, the figure of a
circle, we cannot possibly perceive by sense whether
it be a true circle or no; than which, nevertheless,
nothing is more easy to be known to him
that knows first the generation of the propounded
figure. For let it be known that the figure was
made by the circumduction of a body whereof one
end remained unmoved, and we may reason thus;
a body carried about, retaining always the same
length, applies itself first to one <em>radius</em>, then to
another, to a third, a fourth, and successively to
all; and, therefore, the same length, from the same
point, toucheth the circumference in every part
thereof, which is as much as to say, as all the <em>radii</em>
are equal. We know, therefore, that from such
generation proceeds a figure, from whose one
middle point all the extreme points are reached
unto by equal <em>radii</em>. And in like manner, by
knowing first what figure is set before us, we may
come by ratiocination to some generation of the
same, though perhaps not that by which it was
made, yet that by which it might have been made;
for he that knows that a circle has the property
above declared, will easily know whether a body
carried about, as is said, will generate a circle or
no.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Scope of Philosophy.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span><a id='art1.6'></a>6. The <em>end</em> or <em>scope</em> of philosophy is, that we
may make use to our benefit of effects formerly
seen; or that, by application of bodies to one
another, we may produce the like effects of those
we conceive in our mind, as far forth as matter,
strength, and industry, will permit, for the commodity
of human life. For the inward glory and
triumph of mind that a man may have for the mastering
of some difficult and doubtful matter, or for
the discovery of some hidden truth, is not worth
so much pains as the study of Philosophy requires;
nor need any man care much to teach another
what he knows himself, if he think that will be the
only benefit of his labour. The end of knowledge
is power; and the use of theorems (which, among
geometricians, serve for the finding out of properties)
is for the construction of problems; and,
lastly, the scope of all speculation is the performing
of some action, or thing to be done.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Utility of Philosophy.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art1.7'></a>7. But what the <em>utility</em> of philosophy is, especially
of natural philosophy and geometry, will be
best understood by reckoning up the chief commodities
of which mankind is capable, and by
comparing the manner of life of such as enjoy
them, with that of others which want the same.
Now, the greatest commodities of mankind are the
arts; namely, of measuring matter and motion; of
moving ponderous bodies; of architecture; of
navigation; of making instruments for all uses;
of calculating the celestial motions, the aspects of
the stars, and the parts of time; of geography, &#38;c.
By which sciences, how great benefits men receive
is more easily understood than expressed. These
benefits are enjoyed by almost all the people of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Europe, by most of those of Asia, and by some of
Africa: but the Americans, and they that live near
the Poles, do totally want them. But why? Have
they sharper wits than these? Have not all men
one kind of soul, and the same faculties of mind?
What, then, makes this difference, except philosophy?
Philosophy, therefore, is the cause of all
these benefits. But the utility of moral and civil
philosophy is to be estimated, not so much by the
commodities we have by knowing these sciences,
as by the calamities we receive from not knowing
them. Now, all such calamities as may be avoided
by human industry, arise from war, but chiefly
from civil war; for from this proceed slaughter,
solitude, and the want of all things. But the cause
of war is not that men are willing to have it; for
the will has nothing for object but good, at least
that which seemeth good. Nor is it from this,
that men know not that the effects of war are
evil; for who is there that thinks not poverty
and loss of life to be great evils? The cause,
therefore, of civil war is, that men know not the
causes neither of war nor peace, there being but
few in the world that have learned those duties
which unite and keep men in peace, that is to say,
that have learned the rules of civil life sufficiently.
Now, the knowledge of these rules is moral philosophy.
But why have they not learned them,
unless for this reason, that none hitherto have
taught them in a clear and exact method? For
what shall we say? Could the ancient masters of
Greece, Egypt, Rome, and others, persuade the
unskilful multitude to their innumerable opinions
concerning the nature of their gods, which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>themselves knew not whether they were true or
false, and which were indeed manifestly false and
absurd; and could they not persuade the same
multitude to civil duty, if they themselves had
understood it? Or shall those few writings of
geometricians which are extant, be thought sufficient
for the taking away of all controversy in the
matters they treat of, and shall those innumerable
and huge volumes of <em>ethics</em> be thought unsufficient,
if what they teach had been certain and well demonstrated?
What, then, can be imagined to be
the cause that the writings of those men have
increased science, and the writings of these have
increased nothing but words, saving that the former
were written by men that knew, and the
latter by such as knew not, the doctrine they
taught only for ostentation of their wit and eloquence?
Nevertheless, I deny not but the reading
of some such books is very delightful; for they
are most eloquently written, and contain many
clear, wholesome and choice sentences, which yet
are not universally true, though by them universally
pronounced. From whence it comes to pass,
that the circumstances of times, places, and persons
being changed, they are no less frequently
made use of to confirm wicked men in their purposes,
than to make them understand the precepts
of civil duties. Now that which is chiefly wanting
in them, is a true and certain rule of our actions,
by which we might know whether that we undertake
be just or unjust. For it is to no purpose to
be bidden in every thing to do right, before there
be a certain rule and measure of right established,
which no man hitherto hath established. Seeing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>therefore, from the not knowing of civil duties,
that is, from the want of moral science, proceed
civil wars, and the greatest calamities of mankind,
we may very well attribute to such science the
production of the contrary commodities. And
thus much is sufficient, to say nothing of the praises
and other contentment proceeding from philosophy,
to let you see the utility of the same in every kind
thereof.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Subject of Philosophy.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art1.8'></a>8. The <em>subject</em> of Philosophy, or the matter it
treats of, is every body of which we can conceive
any generation, and which we may, by any consideration
thereof, compare with other bodies, or
which is capable of composition and resolution;
that is to say, every body of whose generation or
properties we can have any knowledge. And this
may be deduced from the definition of philosophy,
whose profession it is to search out the properties
of bodies from their generation, or their generation
from their properties; and, therefore, where there
is no generation or property, there is no philosophy.
Therefore it excludes <em>Theology</em>, I mean
the doctrine of God, eternal, ingenerable, incomprehensible,
and in whom there is nothing neither
to divide nor compound, nor any generation to be
conceived.</p>

<p class='c001'>It excludes the doctrine of <em>angels</em>, and all such
things as are thought to be neither bodies nor
properties of bodies; there being in them no place
neither for composition nor division, nor any capacity
of more and less, that is to say, no place for
ratiocination.</p>

<p class='c001'>It excludes <em>history</em>, as well <em>natural</em> as <em>political</em>,
though most useful (nay necessary) to philosophy;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>because such knowledge is but experience, or
authority, and not ratiocination.</p>

<p class='c001'>It excludes all such knowledge as is acquired by
Divine inspiration, or revelation, as not derived to
us by reason, but by Divine grace in an instant,
and, as it were, by some sense supernatural.</p>

<p class='c001'>It excludes not only all doctrines which are
false, but such also as are not well-grounded; for
whatsoever we know by right ratiocination, can
neither be false nor doubtful; and, therefore, <em>astrology</em>,
as it is now held forth, and all such divinations
rather than sciences, are excluded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, the doctrine of <i>God's worship</i> is excluded
from philosophy, as being not to be known by
natural reason, but by the authority of the Church;
and as being the object of faith, and not of knowledge.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Parts of Philosophy.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art1.9'></a>9. The principal parts of philosophy are two.
For two chief kinds of bodies, and very different
from one another, offer themselves to such as
search after their generation and properties; one
whereof being the work of nature, is called a <em>natural
body</em>, the other is called a <em>commonwealth</em>, and
is made by the wills and agreement of men. And
from these spring the two parts of philosophy,
called <em>natural</em> and <em>civil</em>. But seeing that, for the
knowledge of the properties of a commonwealth,
it is necessary first to know the dispositions, affections,
and manners of men, civil philosophy is again
commonly divided into two parts, whereof one,
which treats of men's dispositions and manners, is
called <em>ethics</em>; and the other, which takes cognizance
of their civil duties, is called <em>politics</em>, or
simply <em>civil philosophy</em>. In the first place, therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>(after I have set down such premises as appertain
to the nature of philosophy in general), I
will discourse of <em>bodies natural</em>; in the second,
of the <em>dispositions and manners of men</em>; and in
the third, of the <em>civil duties of subjects</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Epilogue.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art1.10'></a>10. To conclude; seeing there may be many
who will not like this my definition of philosophy,
and will say, that, from the liberty which a man
may take of so defining as seems best to himself,
he may conclude any thing from any thing (though
I think it no hard matter to demonstrate that this
definition of mine agrees with the sense of all men);
yet, lest in this point there should be any cause of
dispute betwixt me and them, I here undertake
no more than to deliver the elements of that science
by which the effects of anything may be found out
from the known generation of the same, or contrarily,
the generation from the effects; to the end
that they who search after other philosophy, may
be admonished to seek it from other principles.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Necessity of sensible Moniments or Marks for the help of Memory.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.1'></a>1. How unconstant and fading men's thoughts
are, and how much the recovery of them depends
upon chance, there is none but knows by infallible
experience in himself. For no man is able to remember
quantities without sensible and present
measures, nor colours without sensible and present
patterns, nor number without the names of numbers
disposed in order and learned by heart. So
that whatsoever a man has put together in his
mind by ratiocination without such helps, will
presently slip from him, and not be revocable but
by beginning his ratiocination anew. From which
it follows, that, for the acquiring of philosophy,
some sensible moniments are necessary, by which
our past thoughts may be not only reduced, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>also registered every one in its own order.<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A Mark defined<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> These
moniments I call <span class='fss'>MARKS</span>, namely, sensible things
taken at pleasure, that, by the sense of them, such
thoughts may be recalled to our mind as are like
those thoughts for which we took them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Necessity of Marks for the signification of the conceptions of the Mind.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.2'></a>2. Again, though some one man, of how excellent
a wit soever, should spend all his time partly
in reasoning, and partly in inventing marks for
the help of his memory, and advancing himself in
learning; who sees not that the benefit he reaps to
himself will not be much, and to others none at
all? For unless he communicate his notes with
others, his science will perish with him. But if
the same notes be made common to many, and so
one man's inventions be taught to others, sciences
will thereby be increased to the general good of
mankind. It is therefore necessary, for the acquiring
of philosophy, that there be certain signs,
by which what one man finds out may be manifested
and made known to others. Now, those
things we call <span class='fss'>SIGNS</span> are the <em>antecedents of their
consequents, and the consequents of their antecedents,
as often as we observe them to go before
or follow after in the same manner</em>. For example,
a thick cloud is a sign of rain to follow, and rain a
sign that a cloud has gone before, for this reason
only, that we seldom see clouds without the consequence
of rain, nor rain at any time but when a
cloud has gone before. And of signs, some are
<em>natural</em>, whereof I have already given an example,
others are <em>arbitrary</em>, namely, those we make choice
of at our own pleasure, as a bush hung up, signifies
that wine is to be sold there; a stone set in
the ground signifies the bound of a field; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>words so and so connected, signify the cogitations
and motions of our mind. The difference, therefore,
betwixt marks and signs is this, that we
make those for our own use, but these for the use
of others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Names supply both those necessities.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.3'></a>3. Words so connected as that they become
signs of our thoughts, are called <span class='fss'>SPEECH</span>, of which
every part is a <em>name</em>. But seeing (as is said) both
marks and signs are necessary for the acquiring of
philosophy, (marks by which we may remember
our own thoughts, and signs by which we may
make our thoughts known to others), names do
both these offices; but they serve for marks before
they be used as signs. For though a man were
alone in the world, they would be useful to him
in helping him to remember; but to teach others,
(unless there were some others to be taught) of
no use at all. Again, names, though standing
singly by themselves, are marks, because they serve
to recal our own thoughts to mind; but they cannot
be signs, otherwise than by being disposed and
ordered in speech as parts of the same. For example,
a man may begin with a word, whereby the
hearer may frame an idea of something in his
mind, which, nevertheless, he cannot conceive to
be the idea which was in the mind of him that
spake, but that he would say something which
began with that word, though perhaps not as by
itself, but as part of another word. So that the
nature of a name consists principally in this, that
it is a mark taken for memory's sake; but it serves
also by accident to signify and make known to
others what we remember ourselves, and, therefore,
I will define it thus:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Definition of a Name.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><a id='art2.4'></a>4. <em>A</em> <span class='fss'>NAME</span> <em>is a word taken at pleasure to serve
for a mark, which may raise in our mind a thought
like to some thought we had before, and which
being pronounced to others, may be to them a
sign of what thought the speaker had, or had not
before in his mind</em>. And it is for brevity's sake
that I suppose the original of names to be arbitrary,
judging it a thing that may be assumed as
unquestionable. For considering that new names
are daily made, and old ones laid aside; that
diverse nations use different names, and how impossible
it is either to observe similitude, or make
any comparison betwixt a name and a thing, how
can any man imagine that the names of things
were imposed from their natures? For though
some names of living creatures and other things,
which our first parents used, were taught by God
himself; yet they were by him arbitrarily imposed,
and afterwards, both at the Tower of Babel, and
since, in process of time, growing everywhere out
of use, are quite forgotten, and in their room have
succeeded others, invented and received by men
at pleasure. Moreover, whatsoever the common
use of words be, yet philosophers, who were to
teach their knowledge to others, had always the
liberty, and sometimes they both had and will have
a necessity, of taking to themselves such names as
they please for the signifying of their meaning, if
they would have it understood. Nor had mathematicians
need to ask leave of any but themselves
to name the figures they invented, <em>parabolas</em>, <em>hyperboles</em>,
<em>cissoeides</em>, <em>quadratices</em>, &#38;c. or to call
one magnitude A, another B.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Names are signs not of things, but of our cogitations.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span><a id='art2.5'></a>5. But seeing names ordered in speech (as is
defined) are signs of our conceptions, it is manifest
they are not signs of the things themselves;
for that the sound of this word <em>stone</em> should be
the sign of a stone, cannot be understood in any
sense but this, that he that hears it collects that
he that pronounces it thinks of a stone. And,
therefore, that disputation, whether names signify
the matter or form, or something compounded of
both, and other like subtleties of the <em>metaphysics</em>,
is kept up by erring men, and such as understand
not the words they dispute about.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What it is we give names to.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.6'></a>6. Nor, indeed, is it at all necessary that every
name should be the name of something. For as
these, a <em>man</em>, a <em>tree</em>, a <em>stone</em>, are the names of the
things themselves, so the images of a man, of a
tree, and of a stone, which are represented to men
sleeping, have their names also, though they be
not things, but only fictions and phantasms of
things. For we can remember these; and, therefore,
it is no less necessary that they have names
to mark and signify them, than the things themselves.
Also this word <em>future</em> is a name, but no
future thing has yet any being, nor do we know
whether that which we call future, shall ever have
a being or no. Nevertheless, seeing we use in our
mind to knit together things past with those that
are present, the name <em>future</em> serves to signify such
knitting together. Moreover, that which neither
is, nor has been, nor ever shall, or ever can be,
has a name, namely, <em>that which neither is nor has
been</em>, &#38;c.; or more briefly this, <em>impossible</em>. To
conclude; this word <em>nothing</em> is a name, which yet
cannot be the name of any thing: for when, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>example, we substract 2 and 3 from 5, and so
nothing remaining, we would call that substraction
to mind, this speech <em>nothing remains</em>, and in
it the word <em>nothing</em> is not unuseful. And for the
same reason we say truly, <em>less than nothing</em> remains,
when we substract more from less; for the
mind feigns such remains as these for doctrine's
sake, and desires, as often as is necessary, to call
the same to memory. But seeing every name has
some relation to that which is named, though that
which we name be not always a thing that has a
being in nature, yet it is lawful for doctrine's sake
to apply the word <em>thing</em> to whatsoever we name;
as if it were all one whether that thing be truly
existent, or be only feigned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Names Positive and Negative.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.7'></a>7. The first distinction of names is, that some
are <em>positive</em>, or <em>affirmative</em>, others <em>negative</em>, which
are also called <em>privative</em> and <em>indefinite</em>. <em>Positive</em>
are such as we impose for the likeness, equality,
or identity of the things we consider; <em>negative</em>,
for the diversity, unlikeness, or inequality of the
same. Examples of the former are, <em>a man</em>, <em>a
philosopher</em>; for a <em>man</em> denotes any one of a
multitude of men, and <em>a philosopher</em>, any one of
many philosophers, by reason of their similitude;
also, <em>Socrates</em> is a positive name, because it signifies
always one and the same man. Examples of
<em>negatives</em> are such positives as have the negative
particle <em>not</em> added to them, as <em>not-man</em>, <em>not-philosopher</em>.
But positives were before negatives;
for otherwise there could have been no use at all
of these. For when the name of <em>white</em> was
imposed upon certain things, and afterwards upon
other things, the names of <em>black</em>, <em>blue</em>, <em>transparent</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><i>&#38;c.</i> the infinite dissimilitudes of these
with <em>white</em> could not be comprehended in any one
name, save that which had in it the negation of
white, that is to say, the name <em>not-white</em>, or some
other equivalent to it, in which the word <em>white</em> is
repeated, such as <em>unlike to white</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i> And by
these <em>negative names</em>, we take notice ourselves,
and signify to others what we have not thought of.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Contradictory names.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.8'></a>8. Positive and negative names are <em>contradictory</em>
to one another, so that they cannot both
be the name of the same thing. Besides, of contradictory
names, one is the name of anything
whatsoever; for whatsoever is, is either man, or
not-man, white or not-white, and so of the rest.
And this is so manifest, that it needs no farther
proof or explication; for they that say <em>the same
thing cannot both be, and not be</em>, speak obscurely;
but they that say, <em>whatsoever is, either is, or is
not</em>, speak also absurdly and ridiculously. The
certainty of this axiom, viz. <em>of two contradictory
names, one is the name of anything whatsoever,
the other not</em>, is the original and foundation of all
ratiocination, that is, of all philosophy; and
therefore it ought to be so exactly propounded,
that it may be of itself clear and perspicuous to
all men; as indeed it is, saving to such, as
reading the long discourses made upon this subject
by the writers of <em>metaphysics</em> (which they
believe to be some egregious learning) think they
understand not, when they do.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A common name.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.9'></a>9. Secondly, of names, some are <em>common</em> to
many things, as a <em>man</em>, <em>a tree</em>; others <em>proper</em> to
one thing, as <em>he that writ the Iliad</em>, <em>Homer</em>, <em>this
man</em>, <em>that man</em>. And a common name, being the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>name of many things severally taken, but not
collectively of all together (as man is not the name
of all mankind, but of every one, as of Peter,
John, and the rest severally) is therefore called an
<em>universal name</em>; and therefore this word <em>universal</em>
is never the name of any thing existent in
nature, nor of any idea or phantasm formed in the
mind, but always the name of some word or
name; so that when <em>a living creature</em>, <em>a stone</em>, <em>a
spirit</em>, or any other thing, is said to be <em>universal</em>,
it is not to be understood, that any man, stone,
&#38;c. ever was or can be universal, but only that
these words, <em>living creature</em>, <em>stone</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i> are <em>universal
names</em>, that is, names common to many
things; and the conceptions answering them in
our mind, are the images and phantasms of
several living creatures, or other things. And
therefore, for the understanding of the extent of
an universal name, we need no other faculty but
that of our imagination, by which we remember
that such names bring sometimes one thing, sometimes
another, into our mind. Also of common
names, some are more, some less common. <em>More
common</em>, is that which is the name of more
things; <em>less common</em>, the name of fewer things;
as <em>living creature</em> is more common than <em>man</em>, or
<em>horse</em>, or <em>lion</em>, because it comprehends them all:
and therefore a more common name, in respect of
a less common, is called the <em>genus</em>, or a <em>general
name</em>; and this in respect of that, the <em>species</em>, or
a <em>special name</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Names of the first and second intention.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.10'></a>10. And from hence proceeds the third distinction
of names, which is, that some are called
names of the <em>first</em>, others of the <em>second intention</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Of the <em>first intention</em> are the names of things,
a <em>man</em>, <em>stone</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i>: of the <em>second</em> are the names
of names and speeches, as <em>universal</em>, <em>particular</em>,
<em>genus</em>, <em>species</em>, <em>syllogism</em>, and the like. But it
is hard to say why those are called names of the
<em>first</em>, and these of the <em>second intention</em>, unless
perhaps it was first intended by us to give names
to those things which are of daily use in this life,
and afterwards to such things as appertain to
science, that is, that our second intention was to
give names to names. But whatsoever the cause
hereof may be, yet this is manifest, that <em>genus</em>,
<em>species</em>, <em>definition</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i> are names of words and
names only; and therefore to put <em>genus</em> and
<em>species</em> for things, and <em>definition</em> for the nature of
any thing, as the writers of <em>metaphysics</em> have
done, is not right, seeing they be only significations
of what we think of the nature of things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Universal, particular, individual, and indefinite names.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.11'></a>11. Fourthly, some names are of <em>certain</em> and
<em>determined</em>, others of <em>uncertain</em> and <em>undetermined</em>
signification. Of <em>determined</em> and <em>certain</em> signification
is, first, that name which is given to any
one thing by itself, and is called an <em>individual
name</em>; as <em>Homer</em>, <em>this tree</em>, <em>that living creature</em>,
&#38;c. Secondly that which has any of these words,
<em>all</em>, <em>every</em>, <em>both</em>, <em>either</em>, or the like added to it;
and it is therefore called an universal name,
because it signifies every one of those things to
which it is common; and of <em>certain</em> signification
for this reason, that he which hears, conceives in
his mind the same thing that he which speaks
would have him conceive. Of <em>indefinite</em> signification
is, first, that name which has the word <em>some</em>,
or the like added to it, and is called a <em>particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>name</em>; secondly, a common name set by itself
without any note either of universality or particularity,
as <em>man</em>, <em>stone</em>, and is called an <em>indefinite
name</em>; but both <em>particular</em> and <em>indefinite</em> names
are of uncertain signification, because the hearer
knows not what thing it is the speaker would have
him conceive; and therefore in speech, particular
and indefinite names are to be esteemed equivalent
to one another. But these words, <em>all</em>, <em>every</em>, <em>some</em>,
<i>&#38;c.</i> which denote universality and particularity,
are not names, but parts only of names; so that
<em>every man</em>, and <em>that man which the hearer conceives
in his mind</em>, are all one; and <em>some man</em>,
and <em>that man which the speaker thought of</em>, signify
the same. From whence it is evident, that the
use of signs of this kind, is not for a man's own
sake, or for his getting of knowledge by his own
private meditation (for every man has his own
thoughts sufficiently determined without such helps
as these) but for the sake of others; that is, for
the teaching and signifying of our conceptions to
others; nor were they invented only to make us
remember, but to make us able to discourse with
others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Names univocal and equivocal.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.12'></a>12. Fifthly, names are usually distinguished
into <em>univocal</em> and <em>equivocal</em>. <em>Univocal</em> are those
which in the same train of discourse signify
always the same thing; but <em>equivocal</em> those which
mean sometimes one thing and sometimes another.
Thus, the name <em>triangle</em> is said to be <em>univocal</em>,
because it is always taken in the same sense; and
<em>parabola</em> to be <em>equivocal</em>, for the signification it
has sometimes of allegory or similitude, and sometimes
of a certain geometrical figure. Also every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><em>metaphor</em> is by profession <em>equivocal</em>. But this
distinction belongs not so much to names, as to
those that use names, for some use them properly
and accurately for the finding out of truth; others
draw them from their proper sense, for ornament
or deceit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Absolute and relative names.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.13'></a>13. Sixthly, of names, some are <em>absolute</em>, others
<em>relative</em>. <em>Relative</em> are such as are imposed for
some comparison, as <em>father</em>, <em>son</em>, <em>cause</em>, <em>effect</em>,
<em>like</em>, <em>unlike</em>, <em>equal</em>, <em>unequal</em>, <em>master</em>, <em>servant</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i>
And those that signify no comparison at all are
<em>absolute names</em>. But, as it was noted above, that
universality is to be attributed to words and names
only, and not to things, so the same is to be said
of other distinctions of names; for no things are
either <em>univocal</em> or <em>equivocal</em>, or <em>relative</em> or <em>absolute</em>.
There is also another distinction of names
into <em>concrete</em> and <em>abstract</em>; but because abstract
names proceed from proposition, and can have no
place where there is no affirmation, I shall speak
of them hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Simple and compounded names.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.14'></a>14. Lastly, there are <em>simple</em> and <em>compounded
names</em>. But here it is to be noted, that a name is
not taken in philosophy, as in grammar, for one
single word, but for any number of words put
together to signify one thing; for among philosophers
<em>sentient animated body</em> passes but for one
name, being the name of every living creature,
which yet, among grammarians, is accounted three
names. Also a <em>simple name</em> is not here distinguished
from a <em>compounded name</em> by a preposition,
as in grammar. But I call a <em>simple name</em>, that
which in every kind is the most common or most
universal; and that a <em>compounded name</em>, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>by the joining of another name to it, is made less
universal, and signifies that more conceptions than
one were in the mind, for which that latter name
was added. For example, in the conception of
<em>man</em> (as is shown in the former chapter.) First,
he is conceived to be something that has extension,
which is marked by the word <em>body</em>. <em>Body</em>,
therefore, is a <em>simple name</em>, being put for that
first single conception; afterwards, upon the sight
of such and such motion, another conception
arises, for which he is called an <em>animated body</em>;
and this I here call a <em>compounded name</em>, as I do
also the name <em>animal</em>, which is equivalent to an
<em>animated body</em>. And, in the same manner, an
<em>animated rational body</em>, as also a <em>man</em>, which is
equivalent to it, is a more compounded name.
And by this we see how the composition of conceptions
in the mind is answerable to the composition
of names; for, as in the mind one idea or
phantasm succeeds to another, and to this a
third; so to one name is added another and
another successively, and of them all is made one
<em>compounded</em> name. Nevertheless we must not
think bodies which are without the mind, are
compounded in the same manner, namely, that
there is in nature a body, or any other imaginable
thing existent, which at the first has no magnitude,
and then, by the addition of magnitude, comes
to have quantity, and by more or less quantity to
have density or rarity; and again, by the addition
of figure, to be figurate, and after this, by the
injection of light or colour, to become lucid or
coloured; though such has been the philosophy
of many.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A predicament described.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><a id='art2.15'></a>15. The writers of <em>logic</em> have endeavoured to
digest the names of all the kinds of things into
certain <em>scales</em> or degrees, by the continual subordination
of names less common, to names more
common. In the scale of <em>bodies</em> they put in the
first and highest place <em>body</em> simply, and in the
next place under it less common names, by which
it may be more limited and determined, namely
<em>animated</em> and <em>inanimated</em>, and so on till they
come to <em>individuals</em>. In like manner, in the
scale of <em>quantities</em>, they assign the first place to
<em>quantity</em>, and the next to <em>line</em>, <em>superficies</em>, and
<em>solid</em>, which are names of less latitude; and these
orders or scales of names they usually call <em>predicaments</em>
and <em>categories</em>. And of this ordination
not only positive, but negative names also are
capable; which may be exemplified by such forms
of the <em>predicaments</em> as follow:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Some things to be noted concerning predicaments.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art2.16'></a>16. Concerning which predicaments it is to be
noted, in the first place, that as the division is
made in the first predicament into contradictory
names, so it might have been done in the rest.
For, as there, <em>body</em> is divided into <em>animated</em> and
<em>not-animated</em>, so, in the second predicament,
<em>continual quantity</em> may be divided into <em>line</em> and
<em>not-line</em>, and again, <em>not-line</em> into <em>superficies</em> and
<em>not-superficies</em>, and so in the rest; but it was not
necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, it is to be observed, that of <em>positive</em>
names the former comprehends the latter; but of
<em>negatives</em> the former is comprehended by the
latter. For example, <em>living-creature</em> is the name
of every man, and therefore it comprehends the
name <em>man</em>; but, on the contrary, <em>not-man</em> is the
name of everything which is not-living-creature,
and therefore the name <em>not-living-creature</em>, which
is put first, is comprehended by the latter name,
<em>not-man</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, we must take heed that we do not
think, that as names, so the diversities of things
themselves may be searched out and determined
by such distinctions as these; or that arguments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>may be taken from hence (as some have done
ridiculously) to prove that the kinds of things are
not infinite.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fourthly, I would not have any man think I
deliver the forms above for a true and exact ordination
of names; for this cannot be performed
as long as philosophy remains imperfect; nor that
by placing (for example) <em>light</em> in the predicament
of <em>qualities</em>, while another places the same in the
predicament of bodies, I pretend that either of
us ought for this to be drawn from his opinion;
for this is to be done only by arguments and
ratiocination, and not by disposing of words into
<em>classes</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, I confess I have not yet seen any great
use of the predicaments in philosophy. I believe
<em>Aristotle</em> when he saw he could not digest the
things themselves into such orders, might nevertheless
desire out of his own authority to reduce
words to such forms, as I have done; but I do it
only for this end, that it may be understood what
this ordination of words is, and not to have it
received for true, till it be demonstrated by good
reason to be so.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Divers kinds of speech.</div>

<p class='c006'><a id='art3.1'></a>1. From the connexion or contexture of names
arise divers kinds of speech, whereof some signify
the desires and affections of men; such are, first,
<em>interrogations</em>, which denote the desire of knowing:
as, <em>Who is a good man?</em> In which speech
there is one name expressed, and another desired
and expected from him of whom we ask the same.
Then <em>prayers</em>, which signify the desire of having
something; <em>promises</em>, <em>threats</em>, <em>wishes</em>, <em>commands</em>,
<em>complaints</em>, and other significations of other
affections. Speech may also be absurd and insignificant;
as when there is a succession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>words, to which there can be no succession of
thoughts in mind to answer them; and this happens
often to such, as, understanding nothing in
some subtle matter, do, nevertheless, to make
others believe they understand, speak of the same
incoherently; for the connection of incoherent
words, though it want the end of speech (which
is signification) yet it is speech; and is used by
writers of <em>metaphysics</em> almost as frequently as
speech significative. In philosophy, there is but
one kind of speech useful, which some call in Latin
<em>dictum</em>, others <span lang="la"><i>enuntiatum  et pronunciatum</i></span>;  but
most men call it <em>proposition</em>, and is the speech of
those that affirm or deny, and expresseth truth or
falsity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proposition defined.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.2'></a>2. <em>A</em> <span class='fss'>PROPOSITION</span> <em>is a speech consisting of
two names copulated, by which he that speaketh
signifies he conceives the latter name to be the
name of the same thing whereof the former is
the name; or</em> (which is all one) <em>that the former
name is comprehended by the latter</em>. For example,
this speech, <em>man is a living creature</em>, in which
two names are copulated by the verb <em>is</em>, is a <em>proposition</em>,
for this reason, that he that speaks it
conceives both <em>living creature</em> and <em>man</em> to be
names of the same thing, or that the former name,
<em>man</em>, is comprehended by the latter name, <em>living
creature</em>. Now the former name is commonly
called the <em>subject</em>, or <em>antecedent</em>, or the <em>contained
name</em>, and the latter <em>predicate</em>, <em>consequent</em>,
or <em>containing name</em>. The sign of connection
amongst most nations is either some word, as the
word <em>is</em> in the proposition <em>man is a living creature</em>,
or some case or termination of a word, as in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>proposition, <em>man walketh</em> (which is equivalent to
this, <em>man is walking</em>); the termination by which it
is said he <em>walketh</em>, rather than he <em>is walking</em>,
signifieth that those two are understood to be
copulated, or to be names of the same thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>But there are, or certainly may be, some nations
that have no word which answers to our verb <em>is</em>,
who nevertheless form propositions by the position
only of one name after another, as if instead of
<em>man is a living creature</em>, it should be said <em>man
a living creature</em>; for the very order of the
names may sufficiently show their connection;
and they are as apt and useful in philosophy, as if
they were copulated by the verb <em>is</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Subject, predicate, and copula, what they are, and abstract and concrete what.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.3'></a>3. Wherefore, in every proposition three things
are to be considered, <i>viz.</i> the two names, which
are the <em>subject</em>, and the <em>predicate</em>, and their
<em>copulation</em>; both which names raise in our mind
the thought of one and the same thing; but the
copulation makes us think of the cause for which
those names were imposed on that thing. As, for
example, when we say <em>a body is moveable</em>, though
we conceive the same thing to be designed by
both those names, yet our mind rests not there,
but searches farther what it is <em>to be a body</em>, or <em>to
be moveable</em>, that is, wherein consists the difference
betwixt these and other things, for which
these are so called, others are not so called.
They, therefore, that seek what it is <em>to be</em> any
thing, as <em>to be moveable</em>, <em>to be hot</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i> seek in
things the causes of their names.</p>

<p class='c001'>And from hence arises that distinction of names
(touched in the last chapter) into <em>concrete</em> and
<em>abstract</em>. For <em>concrete</em> is the name of any thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>which we suppose to have a being, and is therefore
called the <em>subject</em>, in Latin <span lang="la"><i>suppositum</i></span>, and
in Greek ὑποκέιμενον; as <em>body</em>, <em>moveable</em>, <em>moved</em>,
<em>figurate</em>, <em>a cubit high</em>, <em>hot</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>like</em>, <em>equal</em>,
<em>Appius</em>, <em>Lentulus</em>, and the like; and, <em>abstract</em>
is that which in any subject denotes the cause
of the concrete name, as <em>to be a body</em>, <em>to be
moveable</em>, <em>to be moved</em>, <em>to be figurate</em>, <em>to be of
such quantity</em>, <em>to be hot</em>, <em>to be cold</em>, <em>to be like</em>,
<em>to be equal</em>, <em>to be Appius</em>, <em>to be Lentulus</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i>
Or names equivalent to these, which are most
commonly called <em>abstract</em> names, as <em>corporiety</em>,
<em>mobility</em>, <em>motion</em>, <em>figure</em>, <em>quantity</em>, <em>heat</em>, <em>cold</em>,
<em>likeness</em>, <em>equality</em>, and (as Cicero has it) <em>Appiety</em>
and <em>Lentulity</em>. Of the same kind also are infinitives;
for <em>to live</em> and <em>to move</em> are the same with
<em>life</em> and <em>motion</em>, or <em>to be living</em> and <em>to be moved</em>.
But <em>abstract names</em> denote only the causes of
<em>concrete names</em>, and not the things themselves.
For example, when we see any thing, or conceive
in our mind any visible thing, that thing appears
to us, or is conceived by us, not in one point, but
as having parts distant from one another, that is,
as being extended and filling some space. Seeing
therefore we call the thing so conceived <em>body</em>,
the cause of that name is, that that thing is
<em>extended</em>, or the <em>extension</em> or <em>corporiety</em> of it.
So when we see a thing appear sometimes here,
sometimes there, and call it <em>moved</em> or <em>removed</em>,
the cause of that name is that it <em>is moved</em> or the
<em>motion</em> of the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>And these causes of names are the same with
the causes of our conceptions, namely, some
power of action, or affection of the thing conceived,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>which some call the manner by which any
thing works upon our senses, but by most men
they are called <em>accidents</em>; I say accidents, not in
that sense in which accident is opposed to
necessary; but so, as being neither the things
themselves, nor parts thereof, do nevertheless
accompany the things in such manner, that (saving
extension) they may all perish, and be destroyed,
but can never be abstracted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The use and abuse of names abstract.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.4'></a>4. There is also this difference betwixt <em>concrete</em>
and <em>abstract</em> names, that those were invented
before propositions, but these after; for these
could have no being till there were propositions,
from whose <em>copula</em> they proceed. Now in all
matters that concern this life, but chiefly in philosophy,
there is both great use and great abuse of
<em>abstract names</em>; and the use consists in this, that
without them we cannot, for the most part, either
reason, or compute the properties of bodies; for
when we would multiply, divide, add, or substract
heat, light, or motion, if we should double or add
them together by concrete names, saying (for
example) hot is double to hot, light double to
light, or moved double to moved, we should not
double the properties, but the bodies themselves
that are hot, light, moved, &#38;c. which we would
not do. But the abuse proceeds from this, that
some men seeing they can consider, that is (as I
said before) bring into account the increasings
and decreasings of quantity, heat and other accidents,
without considering their bodies or subjects
(which they call <em>abstracting</em>, or making to exist
apart by themselves) they speak of accidents, as
if they might be separated from all bodies. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>from hence proceed the gross errors of writers
of metaphysics; for, because they can consider
thought without the consideration of body, they
infer there is no need of a thinking-body; and
because quantity may be considered without considering
body, they think also that quantity may
be without body, and body without quantity; and
that a body has quantity by the addition of quantity
to it. From the same fountain spring those
insignificant words, <em>abstract substance</em>, <em>separated
essence</em>, and the like; as also that confusion of
words derived from the Latin verb <span lang="la"><i>est</i></span>, as <em>essence</em>,
<em>essentiality</em>, <em>entity</em>, <em>entitative</em>; besides <em>reality</em>,
<em>aliquiddity</em>, <em>quiddity</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i> which could never
have been heard of among such nations as do not
copulate their names by the verb <em>is</em>, but by
adjective verbs, as runneth, readeth, &#38;c. or by
the mere placing of one name after another; and
yet seeing such nations compute and reason, it is
evident that philosophy has no need of those
words <em>essence</em>, <em>entity</em>, and other the like barbarous
terms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proposition, universal and particular.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.5'></a>5. There are many distinctions of propositions,
whereof the first is, that some are <em>universal</em>,
others <em>particular</em>, others <em>indefinite</em>, and others
<em>singular</em>; and this is commonly called the distinction
of <em>quantity</em>. An <em>universal</em> proposition is
that whose subject is affected with the sign of an
universal name, as <em>every man is a living creature</em>.
<em>Particular</em>, that whose subject is affected with
the sign of a particular name, as <em>some man is
learned</em>. An <em>indefinite</em> proposition has for its
subject a common name, and put without any
sign, as <em>man is a living creature</em>, <em>man is learned</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>And a <em>singular</em> proposition is that whose subject
is a singular name, as <em>Socrates is a philosopher</em>,
<em>this man is black</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Affirmative and negative.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.6'></a>6. The second distinction is into <em>affirmative</em>
and <em>negative</em>, and is called the distinction of
<em>quality</em>. An <em>affirmative</em> proposition is that whose
predicate is a positive name, as <em>man is a living
creature</em>. <em>Negative</em>, that whose predicate is a
negative name, as <em>man is not a stone</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>True &#38; false.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.7'></a>7. The third distinction is, that one is <em>true</em>,
another <em>false</em>. A <em>true</em> proposition is that, whose
predicate contains, or comprehends its subject, or
whose predicate is the name of every thing, of
which the subject is the name; as <em>man is a living
creature</em> is therefore a true proposition, because
whatsoever is called <em>man</em>, the same is also called
<em>living creature</em>; and <em>some man is sick</em>, is true,
because <em>sick</em> is the name of <em>some man</em>. That
which is not true, or that whose predicate does
not contain its subject, is called a <em>false</em> proposition,
as <em>man is a stone</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now these words <em>true</em>, <em>truth</em>, and <em>true proposition</em>,
are equivalent to one another; for truth
consists in speech, and not in the things spoken
of; and though <em>true</em> be sometimes opposed to
<em>apparent</em> or <em>feigned</em>, yet it is always to be referred
to the truth of proposition; for the image of a
man in a glass, or a ghost, is therefore denied to
be a very man, because this proposition, <em>a ghost
is a man</em>, is not true; for it cannot be denied but
that a ghost is a very ghost. And therefore truth
or verity is not any affection of the thing, but of
the proposition concerning it. As for that which
the writers of metaphysics say, that <em>a thing</em>, <em>one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>thing</em>, and <em>a very thing</em>, are equivalent to one
another, it is but trifling and childish; for who
does not know, that <em>a man</em>, <em>one man</em>, and <em>a very
man</em>, signify the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>True &#38; false belongs to speech, and not to things.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.8'></a>8. And from hence it is evident, that truth and
falsity have no place but amongst such living
creatures as use speech. For though some brute
creatures, looking upon the image of a man in a
glass, may be affected with it, as if it were the
man himself, and for this reason fear it or fawn
upon it in vain; yet they do not apprehend it as
true or false, but only as like; and in this they are
not deceived. Wherefore, as men owe all their
true ratiocination to the right understanding of
speech; so also they owe their errors to the misunderstanding
of the same; and as all the ornaments
of philosophy proceed only from man, so
from man also is derived the ugly absurdity of
false opinions. For speech has something in it
like to a spider's web, (as it was said of old of
<i>Solon's</i> laws) for by contexture of words tender
and delicate wits are ensnared and stopped;
but strong wits break easily through them.</p>

<p class='c001'>From hence also this may be deduced, that the
first truths were arbitrarily made by those that
first of all imposed names upon things, or received
them from the imposition of others. For it is
true (for example) that <em>man is a living creature</em>,
but it is for this reason, that it pleased men to
impose both those names on the same thing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proposition, primary, not primary, definition, axiom, petition.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.9'></a>9. Fourthly, propositions are distinguished into
<em>primary</em> and <em>not primary</em>. <em>Primary</em> is that
wherein the subject is explicated by a predicate of
many names, as <em>man is a body</em>, <em>animated</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><em>rational</em>; for that which is comprehended in the
name <em>man</em>, is more largely expressed in the names
<em>body</em>, <em>animated</em>, and <em>rational</em>, joined together;
and it is called <em>primary</em>, because it is first in ratiocination;
for nothing can be proved, without
understanding first the name of the thing in
question. Now <em>primary</em> propositions are nothing
but definitions, or parts of definitions, and these
only are the principles of demonstration, being
truths constituted arbitrarily by the inventors of
speech, and therefore not to be demonstrated.
To these propositions, some have added others,
which they call <em>primary</em> and <em>principles</em>, namely,
<em>axioms</em>, and <em>common notions</em>; which, (though
they be so evident that they need no proof) yet,
because they may be proved, are not truly principles;
and the less to be received for such, in
regard propositions not intelligible, and sometimes
manifestly false, are thrust on us under the
name of <em>principles</em> by the clamour of men, who
obtrude for evident to others, all that they themselves
think true. Also certain petitions are commonly
received into the number of principles; as,
for example, <em>that a straight line may be drawn
between two points</em>, and other petitions of the
writers of geometry; and these are indeed the
principles of art or construction, but not of science
and demonstration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proposition necessary &#38; contingent.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.10'></a>10. Fifthly, propositions are distinguished into
<em>necessary</em>, that is, necessarily true; and true, but
not necessarily, which they call <em>contingent</em>. A
<em>necessary</em> proposition is when nothing can at any
time be conceived or feigned, whereof the subject
is the name, but the predicate also is the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the same thing; as <em>man is a living creature</em> is a
necessary proposition, because at what time
soever we suppose the name <em>man</em> agrees with any
thing, at that time the name <em>living-creature</em> also
agrees with the same. But a <em>contingent</em> proposition
is that, which at one time may be true, at
another time false; as <em>every crow is black</em>; which
may perhaps be true now, but false hereafter.
Again, in every <em>necessary</em> proposition, the predicate
is either equivalent to the subject, as in this,
<em>man is a rational living creature</em>; or part of an
equivalent name, as in this, <em>man is a living creature</em>,
for the name <em>rational-living-creature</em>, or
<em>man</em>, is compounded of these two, <em>rational</em> and
<em>living-creature</em>. But in a <em>contingent</em> proposition
this cannot be; for though this were true, <em>every
man is a liar</em>, yet because the word <em>liar</em> is no part
of a compounded name equivalent to the name
<em>man</em>, that proposition is not to be called <em>necessary</em>,
but <em>contingent</em>, though it should happen to be true
always. And therefore those propositions only
are <em>necessary</em>, which are of sempiternal truth, that
is, true at all times. From hence also it is manifest,
that truth adheres not to things, but to
speech only, for some truths are eternal; for it
will be eternally true, <em>if man, then living-creature</em>;
but that any <em>man</em>, or <em>living-creature</em>, should
exist eternally, is not necessary.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Categorical &#38; hypothetical.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.11'></a>11. A sixth distinction of propositions is into
<em>categorical</em> and <em>hypothetical</em>. A <em>categorical</em>
proposition is that which is simply or absolutely
pronounced, as <em>every man is a living-creature</em>,
<em>no man is a tree</em>; and <em>hypothetical</em> is that which
is pronounced conditionally, as, <em>if any thing be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>man, the same is also a living-creature</em>, <em>if anything
be a man, the same is also not-a-stone</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>A <em>categorical</em> proposition, and an <em>hypothetical</em>
answering it, do both signify the same, if the
propositions be necessary; but not if they be contingent.
For example, if this, <em>every man is a
living-creature</em>, be true, this also will be true, <em>if
any thing be a man, the same is also a living-creature</em>;
but in contingent propositions, though
this be true, <em>every crow is black</em>, yet this, <em>if any
thing be a crow, the same is black</em>, is false. But
an <em>hypothetical</em> proposition is then rightly said
to be true, when the consequence is true, as <em>every
man is a living-creature</em>, is rightly said to be a
true proposition, because of whatsoever it is truly
said <em>that is a man</em>, it cannot but be truly said also,
<em>the same is a living creature</em>. And therefore
whensoever an <em>hypothetical</em> proposition is true,
the <em>categorical</em> answering it, is not only true, but
also necessary; which I thought worth the noting,
as an argument, that philosophers may in most
things reason more solidly by <em>hypothetical</em> than
<em>categorical</em> propositions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The same proposition diversely pronounced.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.12'></a>12. But seeing every proposition may be, and
uses to be, pronounced and written in many forms,
and we are obliged to speak in the same manner
as most men speak, yet they that learn philosophy
from masters, had need to take heed they be not
deceived by the variety of expressions. And
therefore, whensoever they meet with any obscure
proposition, they ought to reduce it to its most
simple and categorical form; in which the copulative
word <em>is</em> must be expressed by itself, and not
mingled in any manner either with the subject or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>predicate, both which must be separated and
clearly distinguished one from another. For
example, if this proposition, <em>man can not sin</em>, be
compared with this, <em>man cannot sin</em>, their difference
will easily appear if they be reduced to
these, <em>man is able not to sin</em>, and, <em>man is not able
to sin</em>, where the predicates are manifestly different.
But they ought to do this silently by
themselves, or betwixt them and their masters
only; for it will be thought both ridiculous and
absurd, for a man to use such language publicly.
Being therefore to speak of <em>equipollent</em> propositions,
I put in the first place all those for <em>equipollent</em>,
that may be reduced purely to one and the
same categorical proposition.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Propositions that may be reduced to the same categorical proposition, are equipollent.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.13'></a>13. Secondly, that which is categorical and
necessary, is <em>equipollent</em> to its hypothetical proposition;
as this categorical, <em>a right-lined triangle
has its three angles equal to two right
angles</em>, to this hypothetical, <em>if any figure be a
right-lined triangle, the three angles of it are
equal to two right angles</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Universal propositions converted by contradictory names, are equipollent.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.14'></a>14. Also, any two universal propositions, of
which the terms of the one (that is, the subject
and predicate) are to the terms of
the other, and their order inverted, as these, <em>every
man is a living creature</em>, and <em>every thing that is
not a living-creature is not a man</em>, are <em>equipollent</em>.
For seeing <em>every man is a living creature</em> is a
true proposition, the name <em>living creature</em> contains
the name <em>man</em>; but they are both positive
names, and therefore (by the last article of the
precedent chapter) the negative name <em>not man</em>,
contains the negative name <em>not living-creature</em>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>wherefore <em>every thing that is not a living-creature,
is not a man</em>, is a true proposition. Likewise
these, <em>no man is a tree</em>, <em>no tree is a man</em>, are
<em>equipollent</em>. For if it be true that <em>tree</em> is not the
name of any <em>man</em>, then no one thing can be signified
by the two names <em>man</em> and <em>tree</em>, wherefore
<em>no tree is a man</em> is a true proposition. Also to
this, <em>whatsoever is not a living-creature is not a
man</em>, where both the terms are negative, this
other proposition is equipollent, <em>only a living creature
is a man</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Negative propositions are the same, whether the negation be before or after the copula.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.15'></a>15. Fourthly, negative propositions, whether
the particle of negation be set after the copula as
some nations do, or before it, as it is in Latin and
Greek, if the terms be the same, are equipollent:
as, for example, <em>man is not a tree</em>, and, <em>man is
not-a-tree</em>, are equipollent, though Aristotle deny
it. Also these, <em>every man is not a tree</em>, and <em>no
man is a tree</em>, are equipollent, and that so manifestly,
as it needs not be demonstrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Particular propositions simply converted, are equipollent.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.16'></a>16. Lastly, all particular propositions that have
their terms inverted, as these, <em>some man is blind,
some blind thing is a man</em>, are equipollent; for
either of the two names, is the name of some one
and the same man; and therefore in which soever
of the two orders they be connected, they signify
the same truth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What are subaltern, contrary, subcontrary, and contradictory propositions.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.17'></a>17. Of propositions that have the same terms,
and are placed in the same order, but varied either
by quantity or quality, some are called <em>subaltern</em>,
others <em>contrary</em>, others <em>subcontrary</em>, and others
<em>contradictory</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Subaltern</em>, are universal and particular propositions
of the same quality; as, <em>every man is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>living creature</em>, <em>some man is a living creature</em>;
or, <em>no man is wise</em>, <em>some man is not wise</em>. Of
these, if the universal be true, the particular will
be true also.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Contrary</em>, are universal propositions of different
quality; as, <em>every man is happy</em>, <em>no man is
happy</em>. And of these, if one be true, the other
is false: also, they may both be false, as in the
example given.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Subcontrary</em>, are particular propositions of
different quality; as, <em>some man is learned</em>, <em>some
man is not learned</em>; which cannot be both false,
but they may be both true.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Contradictory</em> are those that differ both in
quantity and quality; as, <em>every man is a living
creature</em>, <em>some man is not a living-creature</em>;
which can neither be both true, nor both false.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Consequence, what it is.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.18'></a>18. A proposition is said to <em>follow</em> from two
other propositions, when these being granted to
be true, it cannot be denied but the other is true
also. For example, let these two propositions,
<em>every man is a living creature</em>, and, <em>every living
creature is a body</em>, be supposed true, that is, that
<em>body</em> is the name of <em>every living creature</em>, and
<em>living creature</em> the name of <em>every man</em>. Seeing
therefore, if these be understood to be true, it
cannot be understood that <em>body</em> is not the name of
<em>every man</em>, that is, that <em>every man is a body</em> is
false, this proposition will be said to <em>follow</em> from
those two, or to be necessarily <em>inferred</em> from them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Falsity cannot follow from truth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.19'></a>19. That a true proposition may follow from
false propositions, may happen sometimes; but
false from true, never. For if these, <em>every man
is a stone</em>, and <em>every stone is a living creature</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>(which are both false) be granted to be true, it is
granted also that <em>living creature</em> is the name of
<em>every stone</em>, and <em>stone</em> of <em>every man</em>, that is, that
<em>living creature</em> is the name of <em>every man</em>; that
is to say, this proposition <em>every man is a living
creature</em>, is true, as it is indeed true. Wherefore
a true proposition may sometimes follow from
false. But if any two propositions be true, a
false one can never follow from them. For if
true follow from false, for this reason only, that
the false are granted to be true, then truth from
two truths granted will follow in the same manner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How one proposition is the cause of another.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art3.20'></a>20. Now, seeing none but a true proposition
will follow from true, and that the understanding
of two propositions to be true, is the cause of
understanding that also to be true which is
deduced from them; the two antecedent propositions
are commonly called the causes of the
inferred proposition, or conclusion. And from
hence it is that logicians say, the <em>premises</em> are
causes of the <em>conclusion</em>; which may pass, though
it be not properly spoken; for though understanding
be the cause of understanding, yet speech is
not the cause of speech. But when they say, the
cause of the properties of any thing, is the thing
itself, they speak absurdly. For example, if a
figure be propounded which is triangular; seeing
every triangle has all its angles together equal
to two right angles, from whence it follows that
all the angles of that figure are equal to two right
angles, they say, for this reason, that that figure
is the cause of that equality. But seeing the
figure does not itself make its angles, and therefore
cannot be said to be the <em>efficient-cause</em>, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>call it the <em>formal-cause</em>; whereas indeed it is no
cause at all; nor does the property of any figure
follow the figure, but has its being at the same
time with it; only the knowledge of the figure
goes before the knowledge of the properties;
and one knowledge is truly the cause of another
knowledge, namely the <em>efficient cause</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>And thus much concerning <em>proposition</em>; which
in the progress of philosophy is the first step,
like the moving towards of one foot. By the
due addition of another step I shall proceed to
<em>syllogism</em>, and make a complete pace. Of which
in the next chapter.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Definition of syllogism.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.1'></a>1. A <span class='fss'>SPEECH</span>, consisting of three propositions,
from two of which the third follows, is called a
<span class='fss'>SYLLOGISM</span>; and that which follows is called the
<em>conclusion</em>; the other two <em>premises</em>. For example,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>this speech, <em>every man is a living creature</em>,
<em>every living creature is a body</em>, therefore, <em>every
man is a body</em>, is a <em>syllogism</em>, because the third
proposition follows from the two first; that is, if
those be granted to be true, this must also be
granted to be true.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In a syllogism there are but three terms.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.2'></a>2. From two propositions which have not one
term common, no conclusion can follow; and
therefore no <em>syllogism</em> can be made of them.
For let any two premises, <em>a man is a living creature</em>,
<em>a tree is a plant</em>, be both of them true, yet
because it cannot be collected from them that
<em>plant</em> is the name of a <em>man</em>, or <em>man</em> the name of
a <em>plant</em>, it is not necessary that this conclusion, <em>a
man is a plant</em>, should be true. Corollary: therefore,
in the <em>premises</em> of a <em>syllogism</em> there can be
but three <em>terms</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, there can be no term in the <em>conclusion</em>,
which was not in the <em>premises</em>. For let any two
premises be, <em>a man is a living creature</em>, <em>a living
creature is a body</em>, yet if any other term be put
in the conclusion, as <em>man is two-footed</em>; though
it be true, it cannot follow from the premises,
because from them it cannot be collected, that
the name <em>two-footed</em> belongs to a <em>man</em>; and
therefore, again, in every <em>syllogism</em> there can be
but three <em>terms</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Major, minor and middle term; also major and minor proposition, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.3'></a>3. Of these terms, that which is the <em>predicate</em>
in the conclusion, is commonly called the <em>major</em>;
that which is the <em>subject</em> in the conclusion,
the <em>minor</em>, and the other is the <em>middle term</em>; as
in this syllogism, <em>a man is a living creature</em>, <em>a
living creature is a body</em>, therefore, <em>a man is a
body</em>, <em>body</em> is the <em>major</em>, <em>man</em> the <em>minor</em>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><em>living creature</em> the <em>middle term</em>. Also of the
premises, that in which the <em>major term</em> is found,
is called the <em>major proposition</em>, and that which
has the <em>minor term</em>, the <em>minor proposition</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The middle term in every syllogism to be determined in both propositions to one and the same thing.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.4'></a>4. If the middle term be not in both the premises
determined to one and the same singular
thing, no conclusion will follow, nor syllogism be
made. For let the minor term be <em>man</em>, the middle
term <em>living creature</em>, and the major term <em>lion</em>;
and let the premises be, <em>man is a living creature</em>,
<em>some living creature is a lion</em>, yet it will not follow
that <em>every</em> or <em>any man is a lion</em>. By which
it is manifest, that in every syllogism, that proposition
which has the middle term for its <em>subject</em>,
ought to be either <em>universal</em> or <em>singular</em>, but not
<em>particular</em> nor <em>indefinite</em>. For example, this syllogism,
<em>every man is a living creature</em>, <em>some living
creature is four-footed</em>, therefore <em>some man is
four-footed</em>, is therefore faulty, because the middle
term, <em>living creature</em>, is in the first of the premises
determined only to <em>man</em>, for there the name of
<em>living creature</em> is given to man only, but in the
latter premise it may be understood of some other
living creature besides man. But if the latter
premise had been <em>universal</em>, as here, <em>every man is
a living creature</em>, <em>every living creature is a body</em>,
therefore <em>every man is a body</em>, the syllogism had
been true; for it would have followed that <em>body</em>
had been the name of <em>every living creature</em>, that
is of <em>man</em>; that is to say, the conclusion <em>every man
is a body</em> had been true. Likewise, when the
middle term is a <em>singular</em> name, a syllogism may
be made, I say a true syllogism, though useless in
philosophy, as this, <em>some man is Socrates</em>, <em>Socrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>is a philosopher</em>, therefore, <i>some man is a philosopher</i>;
for the premises being granted, the conclusion
cannot be denied.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>From two particular propositions nothing can be concluded.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.5'></a>5. And therefore of two premises, in both
which the middle term is particular, a syllogism
cannot be made; for whether the middle term be
the <em>subject</em> in both the premises, or the <em>predicate</em>
in both, or the <em>subject</em> in one, and the <em>predicate</em>
in the other, it will not be necessarily determined
to the same thing. For let the premises be,</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>it will not follow that <em>blind</em> is the name of any

<p class='c006'>the conclusion will not follow, because the name

<div class='sidenote'>A syllogism is the collection of two propositions into one sum.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.6'></a>6. Now it is manifest from what has been said,
that a syllogism is nothing but a collection of the
sum of two propositions, joined together by a
common term, which is called the <em>middle term</em>.
And as proposition is the addition of two names,
so syllogism is the adding together of three.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The figure of a syllogism what it is.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.7'></a>7. Syllogisms are usually distinguished according
to their diversity of <em>figures</em>, that is, by the diverse
position of the middle term. And again in
figure there is a distinction of certain <em>moods</em>,
which consist of the differences of propositions in
<em>quantity</em> and <em>quality</em>. The first figure is that, in
which the terms are placed one after another
according to their latitude of signification; in
which order the <em>minor term</em> is first, the <em>middle
term</em> next, and the <em>major</em> last; as, if the minor
term be <em>man</em>, the middle term, <em>living creature</em>,
and the major term, <em>body</em>, then, <em>man is a living-creature,
is a body</em>, will be a syllogism in the first
figure: in which, <em>man is a living creature</em> is the
minor proposition; the major, <em>living creature is
a body</em>, and the conclusion, or sum of both, <em>man is
a body</em>. Now this figure is called <em>direct</em>, because
the terms stand in direct order; and it is varied
by <em>quantity</em> and <em>quality</em> into four <em>moods</em>: of
which the first is that wherein all the terms are
<em>positive</em>, and the minor term <em>universal</em>, as <em>every
man is a living creature</em>, <em>every living creature is
a body</em>: in which all the propositions are affirmative,
and universal. But if the major term be a
negative name, and the minor an universal name,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the <em>figure</em> will be in the second <em>mood</em>, as, <em>every
man is a living creature</em>, <em>every living creature is
not a tree</em>, in which the major proposition and
conclusion are both universal and negative. To
these two, are commonly added two more, by
making the minor term particular. Also it may
happen that both the major and middle terms
are negative terms, and then there arises another
<em>mood</em>, in which all the propositions are negative,
and yet the syllogism will be good; as, if the
minor term be <em>man</em>, the middle term <em>not a stone</em>,
and the major term <em>not a flint</em>, this syllogism,
<em>no man is a stone</em>, <em>whatsoever is not a stone is
not a flint</em>, therefore, <em>no man is a flint</em>, is true,
though it consist of three negatives. But in philosophy,
the profession whereof is to establish
universal rules concerning the properties of things,
seeing the difference betwixt negatives and affirmatives
is only this, that in the former the subject
is affirmed by a negative name, and by a positive
in the latter, it is superfluous to consider any other
<em>mood</em> in direct <em>figure</em>, besides that, in which all
the propositions are both universal and affirmative.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is in the mind answering to a syllogism.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.8'></a>8. The thoughts in the mind answering to a
direct syllogism, proceed in this manner; first,
there is conceived a phantasm of the thing named,
with that accident or quality thereof, for which it
is in the minor proposition called by that name
which is the subject; next, the mind has a phantasm
of the same thing with that accident, or
quality, for which it hath the name, that in the
same proposition is the predicate; thirdly, the
thought returns of the same thing as having that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>accident in it, for which it is called by the name,
that is the predicate of the major proposition;
and lastly, remembering that all those are the accidents
of one and the same thing, it concludes that
those three names are also names of one and the
same thing; that is to say, the conclusion is true.
For example, when this syllogism is made, <em>man is
a living creature</em>, <em>a living creature is a body</em>,
therefore, <em>man is a body</em>, the mind conceives first
an image of a man speaking or discoursing, and
remembers that that, which so appears, is called
<em>man</em>; then it has the image of the same man
moving, and remembers that that, which appears
so, is called <em>living creature</em>; thirdly, it conceives
an image of the same man, as filling some place or
space, and remembers that what appears so is
called <em>body</em>; and lastly, when it remembers that
that thing, which was extended, and moved and
spake, was one and the same thing, it concludes
that the three names, <em>man</em>, <em>living creature</em>, and
<em>body</em>, are names of the same thing, and that therefore
<em>man is a living creature</em> is a true proposition.
From whence it is manifest, that living creatures
that have not the use of speech, have no conception
or thought in the mind, answering to a syllogism
made of universal propositions; seeing it is
necessary to think not only of the thing, but also by
turns to remember the divers names, which for divers
considerations thereof are applied to the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first indirect figure how made.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.9'></a>9. The rest of the figures arise either from the
inflexion, or inversion of the first or direct figure;
which is done by changing the major, or minor,
or both the propositions, into converted propositions
equipollent to them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>From whence follow three other figures; of
which, two are <em>inflected</em>, and the third <em>inverted</em>.
The first of these three is made by the conversion
of the major proposition. For let the minor,
middle, and major terms stand in direct order,
thus, <em>man is a living creature</em>, <em>is not a stone</em>,
which is the first or direct figure; the inflection
will be by converting the major proposition in this
manner, <em>man is a living creature</em>, <em>a stone is not
a living creature</em>; and this is the second figure,
or the first of the indirect figures; in which the
conclusion will be, <em>man is not a stone</em>. For
(having shown in the last chapter, <a href='#art3.14'>art. 14</a>, that
universal propositions, converted by contradiction
of the terms, are equipollent) both those syllogisms
conclude alike; so that if the major be read (like
Hebrew) backwards, thus, <em>a living creature is not
a stone</em>, it will be direct again, as it was before.
In like manner this direct syllogism, <em>man is not a
tree</em>, <em>is not a pear-tree</em>, will be made indirect by
converting the major proposition (by contradiction
of the terms) into another equipollent to it, thus,
<em>man is not a tree</em>, <em>a pear-tree is a tree</em>; for the
same conclusion will follow, <em>man is not a pear-tree</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But for the conversion of the direct figure into
the first indirect figure, the major term in the
direct figure ought to be negative. For though
this direct, <em>man is a living creature</em>, <em>is a body</em>, be
made indirect, by converting the major proposition,
thus,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Man is a living creature</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Not a body is not a living creature</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, <em>Every man is a body</em>;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>Yet this conversion appears so obscure, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>this mood is of no use at all. By the conversion
of the major proposition, it is manifest, that in this
figure, the middle term is always the predicate in
both the premises.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Second indirect figure how made.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.10'></a>10. The second indirect figure is made by converting
the minor proposition, so as that the
middle term is the subject in both. But this
never concludes universally, and therefore is of no
use in philosophy. Nevertheless I will set down
an example of it; by which this direct</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Every man is a living creature</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Every living creature is a body</em>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>by conversion of the minor proposition, will stand
thus,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Some living creature is a man</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Every living creature is a body</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, <i>Some man is a body</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>For <i>every <a id='corr52.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='man s'>man is</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_52.17'><ins class='correction' title='man s'>man is</ins></a></span> a living creature</i> cannot be
converted into this, <em>every living creature is a
man</em>: and therefore if this syllogism be restored
to its direct form, the minor proposition will be
<em>some man is a living creature</em>, and consequently
the conclusion will be <em>some man is a body</em>, seeing
the minor term <em>man</em>, which is the subject in the
conclusion, is a particular name.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How the third indirect figure is made.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.11'></a>11. The third indirect or inverted figure, is
made by the conversion of both the premises.
For example, this direct syllogism,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Every man is a living creature</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Every living creature is not a stone</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, <i>Every man is not a stone</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>being inverted, will stand thus,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span><i>Every stone is not a living creature</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Whatsoever is not a living creature, is not a man</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, <i>Every stone is not a man</i>;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>which conclusion is the converse of the direct
conclusion, and equipollent to the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>The figures, therefore, of syllogisms, if they be
numbered by the diverse situation of the middle
term only, are but three; in the first whereof, the
middle term has the middle place; in the second,
the last; and in the third, the first place. But if
they be numbered according to the situation of
the terms simply, they are four; for the first may
be distinguished again into two, namely, into
direct and inverted. From whence it is evident,
that the controversy among logicians concerning
the fourth figure, is a mere λογόμαχια, or contention
about the name thereof; for, as for the thing
itself, it is plain that the situation of the terms
(not considering the quantity or quality by which
the moods are distinguished) makes four differences
of syllogisms, which may be called
figures, or have any other name at pleasure.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>There are many moods in every figure, but most of them useless in philosophy.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.12'></a>12. In every one of these figures there are
many moods, which are made by varying the premises
according to all the differences they are
capable of, by quantity and quality; as namely,
in the direct figure there are six moods; in the
first indirect figure, four; in the second, fourteen;
and in the third, eighteen. But because from the
direct figure I rejected as superfluous all moods
besides that which consists of universal propositions,
and whose minor proposition is affirmative,
I do, together with it, reject the moods of the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of the figures which are made by conversion of
the premises in the direct figure.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An hypothetical syllogism when equipollent to a categorical.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art4.13'></a>13. As it was showed before, that in necessary
propositions a categorical and hypothetical proposition
are equipollent; so likewise it is manifest
that a categorical and hypothetical syllogism are
equivalent. For every categorical syllogism, as
this,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Every man is a living creature</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Every living creature is a body</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, <i>Every man is a body</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>is of equal force with this hypothetical syllogism:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>If any thing be a man, the same is also a living creature</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>If any thing be a living creature, the same is a body</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, <i>If any thing be a man, the same is a body</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>In like manner, this categorical syllogism in an
indirect figure,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>No stone is a living creature</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Every man is a living creature</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, <i>No man is a stone</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or, <i>No stone is a man</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>is equivalent to this hypothetical syllogism:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>If any thing be a man, the same is a living creature</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>If any thing be a stone, the same is not a living creature</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, <i>If any thing be a stone, the same is not a man</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or, <i>If any thing be a man, the same is not a stone</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>And thus much seems sufficient for the nature
of syllogisms; (for the doctrine of moods and
figures is clearly delivered by others that have
written largely and profitably of the same). Nor
are precepts so necessary as practice for the
attaining of true ratiocination; and they that
study the demonstrations of mathematicians, will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>sooner learn true logic, than they that spend time
in reading the rules of syllogizing which logicians
have made; no otherwise than little children
learn to go, not by precepts, but by exercising
their feet. This, therefore, may serve for the first
pace in the way to Philosophy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Erring &#38; falsity how they differ. Error of the mind by itself, without the use of words, how it happens.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.1'></a>1.  Men are subject to <em>err</em> not only in affirming and
denying, but also in perception, and in silent
cogitation. In affirming and denying, when they
call any thing by a name, which is not the name
thereof; as if from seeing the sun first by reflection
in water, and afterwards again directly in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>firmament, we should to both those appearances
give the name of sun, and say there are two suns;
which none but men can do, for no other living
creatures have the use of names. This kind of
error only deserves the name of <em>falsity</em>, as arising,
not from sense, nor from the things themselves,
but from pronouncing rashly; for names have
their constitution, not from the species of things,
but from the will and consent of men. And hence
it comes to pass, that men pronounce <em>falsely</em>, by
their own negligence, in departing from such
appellations of things as are agreed upon, and are
not deceived neither by the things, nor by the
sense; for they do not perceive that the thing
they see is called sun, but they give it that name
from their own will and agreement. Tacit
errors, or the errors of sense and cogitation, are
made, by passing from one imagination to the
imagination of another different thing; or by
feigning that to be past, or future, which never
was, nor ever shall be; as when, by seeing the
image of the sun in water, we imagine the sun
itself to be there; or by seeing swords, that there
has been or shall be fighting, because it uses to be
so for the most part; or when from promises we
feign the mind of the promiser to be such and such;
or lastly, when from any sign we vainly imagine
something to be signified, which is not. And
errors of this sort are common to all things that
have sense; and yet the deception proceeds neither
from our senses, nor from the things we perceive;
but from ourselves while we feign such things as
are but mere images to be something more than
images. But neither things, nor imaginations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>things, can be said to be false, seeing they are
truly what they are; nor do they, as signs, promise
any thing which they do not perform; for
they indeed do not promise at all, but we from
them; nor do the clouds, but we, from seeing the
clouds, say it shall rain. The best way, therefore,
to free ourselves from such errors as arise from
natural signs, is first of all, before we begin to
reason concerning such conjectural things, to suppose
ourselves ignorant, and then to make use of
our ratiocination; for these errors proceed from
the want of ratiocination; whereas, errors which
consist in affirmation and negation, (that is, the
falsity of propositions) proceed only from reasoning
amiss. Of these, therefore, as repugnant to philosophy,
I will speak principally.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.2'></a>2. Errors which happen in reasoning, that is,
in syllogizing, consist either in the falsity of the
premises, or of the inference. In the first of these
cases, a syllogism is said to be faulty in the
<em>matter</em> of it; and in the second case, in the
<em>form</em>. I will first consider the matter, namely,
how many ways a proposition may be false; and
next the form, and how it comes to pass, that
when the premises are true, the inference is, notwithstanding,
false.</p>

<p class='c001'>Seeing, therefore, that proposition only is true,
(chap, <span class='fss'>III</span>, <a href='#art3.7'>art. 7</a>) in which are copulated two
names of one and the same thing; and that always
false, in which names of different things are copulated,
look how many ways names of different
things may be copulated, and so many ways a
false proposition may be made.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, all things to which we give names, may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>reduced to these four kinds, namely, <em>bodies</em>, <em>accidents</em>,
<em>phantasms</em>, and <em>names</em> themselves; and therefore,
in every true proposition, it is necessary that
the names copulated, be both of them names of
<em>bodies</em>, or both names of <em>accidents</em>, or both names of
<em>phantasms</em>, or both names of <em>names</em>. For names
otherwise copulated are incoherent, and constitute
a false proposition. It may happen, also, that the
name of a <em>body</em>, of an <em>accident</em>, or of a <em>phantasm</em>,
may be copulated with the name of a <em>speech</em>. So
that copulated names may be incoherent seven
manner of ways.</p>

</table>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Of all which I will give some examples.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Examples of the first manner of incoherency.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.3'></a>3. After the first of these ways propositions are
false, when abstract names are copulated with
concrete names; as (in Latin and Greek) <span lang="la"><i>esse est
ens</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>essentia est ens</i></span>, τὸ τί ἦν ειναὶ (<i>i.</i>); <i>quidditas
est ens</i>, and many the like, which are found in
Aristotle's <cite>Metaphysics</cite>. Also, the <em>understanding
worketh</em>, the <em>understanding understandeth</em>, the
<em>sight seeth</em>; a <em>body</em> is <em>magnitude</em>, a <em>body</em> is
<em>quantity</em>, a <em>body</em> is <em>extension</em>; to <em>be a man</em> is a
<em>man</em>, <em>whiteness</em> is a <em>white thing</em>, &#38;c.; which is
as if one should say, the <em>runner</em> is the <em>running</em>,
or the <em>walk walketh</em>. Moreover, <em>essence</em> is <em>separated</em>,
<em>substance</em> is <em>abstracted</em>: and others like
these, or derived from these, (with which common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>philosophy abounds.) For seeing no <em>subject</em> of
an <em>accident</em> (that is, no <em>body</em>) is an <em>accident</em>: no
name of an <em>accident</em> ought to be given to a <em>body</em>,
nor of a <em>body</em> to an <em>accident</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The second.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.4'></a>4. False, in the second manner, are such propositions
as these; a <em>ghost is a body</em>, or a <em>spirit</em>,
that is, a thin body; <em>sensible species fly up and
down in the air</em>, or <em>are moved hither and thither</em>,
which is proper to bodies; also, a <em>shadow is
moved</em>, or <em>is a body</em>; <em>light is moved</em>, or <em>is a
body</em>; <em>colour is the object of sight</em>, <em>sound of
hearing</em>; <em>space</em> or <em>place is extended</em>; and innumerable
others of this kind. For seeing ghosts,
sensible species, a shadow, light, colour, sound,
space, &#38;c. appear to us no less sleeping than
waking, they cannot be things without us, but
only phantasms of the mind that imagines them;
and therefore the names of these, copulated with
the names of bodies, cannot constitute a true
proposition.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The third.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.5'></a>5. False propositions of the third kind, are such
as these; <span lang="la"><i>genus est ens</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>universale est ens</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>ens
de ente prædicatur</i></span>. For <span lang="la"><i>genus</i></span>, and <span lang="la"><i>universale</i></span>,
and <span lang="la"><i>predicare</i></span>, are names of names, and not of
things. Also, <em>number is infinite</em>, is a false proposition;
for no number can be infinite, but only
the word <em>number</em> is then called an indefinite name
when there is no determined number answering to
it in the mind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The fourth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.6'></a>6. To the fourth kind belong such false propositions
as these, <em>an object is of such magnitude or
figure as appears to the beholders</em>; <em>colour, light,
sound, are in the object</em>; and the like. For the
same object appears sometimes greater, sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>lesser, sometimes square, sometimes round, according
to the diversity of the distance and medium;
but the true magnitude and figure of the thing
seen is always one and the same; so that the
magnitude and figure which appears, is not the
true magnitude and figure of the object, nor anything
but phantasm; and therefore, in such propositions
as these, the names of accidents are
copulated with the names of phantasms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The fifth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.7'></a>7. Propositions are false in the fifth manner,
when it is said that <em>the definition is the essence of
a thing</em>; <em>whiteness</em>, or some other accident, <em>is
the genus, or universal</em>. For definition is not the
essence of any thing, but a speech signifying
what we conceive of the essence thereof; and so
also not whiteness itself, but the word whiteness,
is a genus, or an universal name.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The sixth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.8'></a>8. In the sixth manner they err, that say the
<em>idea of anything is universal</em>; as if there could
be in the mind an image of a man, which were
not the image of some one man, but a man simply,
which is impossible; for every idea is one, and of
one thing; but they are deceived in this, that they
put the <em>name</em> of the thing for the <em>idea</em> thereof.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The seventh.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.9'></a>9. They err in the seventh manner, that make
this distinction between things that have being,
that some of them <em>exist by themselves</em>, others by
<em>accident</em>; namely, because <em>Socrates is a man</em> is
a necessary proposition, and <em>Socrates is a musician</em>
a contingent proposition, therefore they say
some things exist necessarily or by themselves,
others contingently or by accident; whereby,
seeing <em>necessary</em>, <em>contingent</em>, <em>by itself</em>, <em>by accident</em>,
are not names of things, but of propositions, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>that say <em>any thing that has being, exists by accident</em>,
copulate the name of a proposition with the
name of a thing. In the same manner also, they
err, which place some ideas in the understanding,
others in the fancy; as if from the understanding
of this proposition, <em>man is a living creature</em>, we
had one idea or image of a man derived from
sense to the memory, and another to the understanding;
wherein that which deceives them is
this, that they think one idea should be answerable
to a name, another to a proposition, which is
false; for proposition signifies only the order of
those things one after another, which we observe
in the same idea of man; so that this proposition,
<em>man is a living creature</em> raises but one idea in
us, though in that idea we consider that first, for
which he is called man, and next that, for which
he is called living creature. The falsities of propositions
in all these several manners, is to be
discovered by the definitions of the copulated
names.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Falsity of propositions detected by resolving the terms with definitions.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.10'></a>10. But when names of bodies are copulated
with names of bodies, names of accidents with
names of accidents, names of names with names of
names, and names of phantasms, with names of
phantasms, if we, nevertheless, remain still doubtful
whether such propositions are true, we ought
then in the first place to find out the definition of
both those names, and again the definitions of
such names as are in the former definition, and so
proceed by a continual resolution till we come to
a simple name, that is, to the most general or
most universal name of that kind; and if after all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>this, the truth or falsity thereof be not evident,
we must search it out by philosophy, and ratiocination,
beginning from definitions. For every
proposition, universally true, is either a definition,
or part of a definition, or the evidence of it
depends upon definitions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the fault of a syllogism consisting in implication of the terms with the copula.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.11'></a>11. That fault of a syllogism which lies hid in
the form thereof, will always be found either in
the implication of the copula with one of the
terms, or in the equivocation of some word; and
in either of these ways there will be four terms,
which (as I have shewn) cannot stand in a true
syllogism. Now the implication of the copula
with either term, is easily detected by reducing
the propositions to plain and clear predication;
as (for example) if any man should argue thus,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>The hand toucheth the pen</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>The pen toucheth the paper</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, <i>The hand toucheth the paper</i>;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>the fallacy will easily appear by reducing it, thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>The hand, is, touching the pen</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>The pen, is, touching the paper</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, <i>The hand, is, touching the paper</i>;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>where there are manifestly these four terms, <em>the
hand</em>, <em>touching the pen</em>, <em>the pen</em>, and <em>touching the
the paper</em>. But the danger of being deceived by
sophisms of this kind, does not seem to be so
great, as that I need insist longer upon them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the fault which consists in equivocation.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.12'></a>12. And though there may be fallacy in equivocal
terms, yet in those that be manifestly such,
there is none at all; nor in metaphors, for they
profess the transferring of names from one thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>to another. Nevertheless, sometimes equivocals
(and those not very obscure) may deceive; as in
this argumentation:--<i>It belongs to metaphysics
to treat of principles; but the first principle of
all, is, that the same thing cannot both exist and
not exist at the same time; and therefore it
belongs to metaphysics to treat whether the same
thing may both exist and not exist at the same
time</i>; where the fallacy lies in the equivocation
of the word principle; for whereas Aristotle in
the beginning of his <cite>Metaphysics</cite>, says, that <em>the
treating of principles belongs to primary science</em>,
he understands by principles, causes of things,
and certain existences which he calls primary;
but where he says <em>a primary proposition is a
principle</em>, by principle, there, he means the
beginning and cause of knowledge, that is, the
understanding of words, which, if any man want,
he is incapable of learning.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sophistical captions are oftener faulty in the matter than in the form of syllogisms.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art5.13'></a>13. But the <em>captions</em> of sophists and sceptics,
by which they were wont, of old, to deride and
oppose truth, were faulty for the most part, not
in the form, but in the matter of syllogism; and
they deceived not others oftener than they were
themselves deceived. For the force of that famous
argument of Zeno against motion, consisted in
this proposition, <em>whatsoever may be divided into
parts, infinite in number, the same is infinite</em>;
which he, without doubt, thought to be true, yet
nevertheless is false. For to be divided into infinite
parts, is nothing else but to be divided into
as many parts as any man will. But it is not
necessary that a line should have parts infinite in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>number, or be infinite, because I can divide and
subdivide it as often as I please; for how many
parts soever I make, yet their number is finite;
but because he that says parts, simply, without
adding how many, does not limit any number, but
leaves it to the determination of the hearer, therefore
we say commonly, a line may be divided
infinitely; which cannot be true in any other
sense.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Conclusion.</div>

<p class='c001'>And thus much may suffice concerning syllogism,
which is, as it were, the first pace towards
philosophy; in which I have said as much as is
necessary to teach any man from whence all true
argumentation has its force. And to enlarge this
treatise with all that may be heaped together,
would be as superfluous, as if one should (as I
said before) give a young child precepts for the
teaching of him to go; for the art of reasoning is
not so well learned by precepts as by practice, and
by the reading of those books in which the conclusions
are all made by severe demonstration.
And so I pass on to the way of philosophy, that is,
to the method of study.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Method and science defined.</div>

<p class='c006'><a id='art6.1'></a>1. For the understanding of <em>method</em>, it will be
necessary for me to repeat the definition of philosophy,
delivered above (Chap. <span class='fss'>I</span>, <a href='#art1.2'>art. 2.</a>) in this
manner, <i>Philosophy is the knowledge we acquire,
by true ratiocination, of appearances, or apparent
effects, from the knowledge we have of some possible
production or generation of the same; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of such production, as has been or may be, from
the knowledge we have of the effects</i>. <span class='sc'>Method</span>,
therefore, in the study of philosophy, <i>is the
shortest way of finding out effects by their known
causes, or of causes by their known effects</i>. But
we are then said to know any effect, when we
know <i>that there be causes of the same</i>, and <i>in
what subject those causes are</i>, and <i>in what subject
they produce that effect</i>, and <i>in what manner
they work the same</i>. And this is the science of
causes, or, as they call it, of the διότι. All other
science, which is called the ὄτι, is either perception
by sense, or the imagination, or memory
remaining after such perception.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first beginnings, therefore, of knowledge,
are the phantasms of sense and imagination; and
that there be such phantasms we know well enough
by nature; but to know why they be, or from
what causes they proceed, is the work of ratiocination;
which consists (as is said above, in the
1st Chapter, <a href='#art1.2'>Art. 2</a>) in <em>composition</em>, and <em>division</em>
or <em>resolution</em>. There is therefore no method, by
which we find out the causes of things, but is
either <em>compositive</em> or <em>resolutive</em>, or <em>partly compositive</em>,
and <em>partly resolutive</em>. And the resolutive
is commonly called <em>analytical</em> method, as the
compositive is called <em>synthetical</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>It is easier known concerning singular than universal things, that they are; and contrarily it is easier known concerning universal than singular things, why they are, or what are their causes.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.2'></a>2. It is common to all sorts of method, to proceed
from known things to unknown; and this is
manifest from the cited definition of philosophy.
But in knowledge by sense, the whole object is
more known, than any part thereof; as when we
see a man, the conception or whole idea of that
man is first or more known, than the particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>ideas of his being <em>figurate</em>, <em>animate</em>, and <em>rational</em>;
that is, we first see the whole man, and take
notice of his being, before we observe in him those
other particulars. And therefore in any knowledge
of the ὅτι, or that any thing <em>is</em>, the beginning
of our search is from the whole idea; and contrarily,
in our knowledge of the διότι, or of the
causes of any thing, that is, in the sciences, we
have more knowledge of the causes of the parts
than of the whole. For the cause of the whole
is compounded of the causes of the parts; but it
is necessary that we know the things that are to
be compounded, before we can know the whole
compound. Now, by parts, I do not here mean
parts of the thing itself, but parts of its nature;
as, by the parts of man, I do not understand his
head, his shoulders, his arms, &#38;c. but his figure,
quantity, motion, sense, reason, and the like;
which accidents being compounded or put together,
constitute the whole nature of man, but not the
man himself. And this is the meaning of that
common saying, namely, that some things are
more known to us, others more known to nature;
for I do not think that they, which so distinguish,
mean that something is known to nature, which
is known to no man; and therefore, by those
things, that are more known to us, we are to
understand things we take notice of by our senses,
and, by more known to nature, those we acquire
the knowledge of by reason; for in this sense it
is, that the <em>whole</em>, that is, those things that have
universal names, (which, for brevity's sake, I call
<em>universal</em>) are more known to us than the <em>parts</em>,
that is, such things as have names less universal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>(which I therefore call <em>singular</em>); and the causes
of the parts are more known to nature than the
cause of the whole; that is, universals than
singulars.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What it is philosophers seek to know.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.3'></a>3. In the study of philosophy, men search after
science either simply or indefinitely; that is, to
know as much as they can, without propounding
to themselves any limited question; or they
enquire into the cause of some determined appearance,
or endeavour to find out the certainty of
something in question, as what is the cause of
<em>light</em>, of <em>heat</em>, of <em>gravity</em>, of a <em>figure</em> propounded,
and the like; or in what <em>subject</em> any propounded
<em>accident</em> is inherent; or what may conduce most
to the <em>generation</em> of some propounded <em>effect</em> from
many <em>accidents</em>; or in what manner particular
causes ought to be compounded for the production
of some certain effect. Now, according to this
variety of things in question, sometimes the <em>analytical
method</em> is to be used, and sometimes the
<em>synthetical</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first part, by which principles are discovered, is purely analytical.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.4'></a>4. But to those that search after science indefinitely,
which consists in the knowledge of the
causes of all things, as far forth as it may be
attained, (and the causes of singular things are
compounded of the causes of universal or simple
things) it is necessary that they know the causes
of universal things, or of such accidents as are
common to all bodies, that is, to all matter, before
they can know the causes of singular things, that
is, of those accidents by which one thing is distinguished
from another. And, again, they must
know what those universal things are, before they
can know their causes. Moreover, seeing universal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>things are contained in the nature of singular
things, the knowledge of them is to be acquired
by reason, that is, by resolution. For example, if
there be propounded a conception or <em>idea</em> of some
singular thing, as of a <em>square</em>, this square is to be
resolved into a <em>plain, terminated with a certain
number of equal and straight lines and right
angles</em>. For by this resolution we have these
things universal or agreeable to all matter, namely,
<em>line</em>, <em>plain</em>, (which contains <em>superficies</em>) <em>terminated</em>,
<em>angle</em>, <em>straightness</em>, <em>rectitude</em>, and <em>equality</em>;
and if we can find out the causes of these, we may
compound them altogether into the cause of a
square. Again, if any man propound to himself
the conception of <em>gold</em>, he may, by resolving,
come to the ideas of <em>solid</em>, <em>visible</em>, <em>heavy</em>, (that is,
tending to the centre of the earth, or downwards)
and many other more universal than gold itself;
and these he may resolve again, till he come to
such things as are most universal. And in this
manner, by resolving continually, we may come to
know what those things are, whose causes being
first known severally, and afterwards compounded,
bring us to the knowledge of singular things.
I conclude, therefore, that the method of attaining
to the universal knowledge of things, is purely
<em>analytical</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The highest causes, and most universal in every kind, are known by themselves.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.5'></a>5. But the causes of universal things (of those,
at least, that have any cause) are manifest of
themselves, or (as they say commonly) known to
nature; so that they need no method at all; for
they have all but one universal cause, which is
motion. For the variety of all figures arises out
of the variety of those motions by which they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>made; and motion cannot be understood to have
any other cause besides motion; nor has the
variety of those things we perceive by sense, as of
<em>colours</em>, <em>sounds</em>, <em>savours</em>, &#38;c. any other cause than
motion, residing partly in the objects that work
upon our senses, and partly in ourselves, in such
manner, as that it is manifestly some kind of
motion, though we cannot, without ratiocination,
come to know what kind. For though many
cannot understand till it be in some sort demonstrated
to them, that all mutation consists in
motion; yet this happens not from any obscurity
in the thing itself, (for it is not intelligible that
anything can depart either from rest, or from the
motion it has, except by motion), but either by
having their natural discourse corrupted with
former opinions received from their masters, or
else for this, that they do not at all bend their
mind to the enquiring out of truth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Method from principles found out, tending to science simply, what it is.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.6'></a>6. By the knowledge therefore of universals,
and of their causes (which are the first principles
by which we know the διότι of things) we have in
the first place their definitions, (which are nothing
but the explication of our simple conceptions.)
For example, he that has a true conception of
<em>place</em>, cannot be ignorant of this definition, <em>place
is that space which is possessed or filled adequately
by some body</em>; and so, he that conceives
<em>motion</em> aright, cannot but know that <em>motion is
the privation of one place, and the acquisition of
another</em>. In the next place, we have their generations
or descriptions; as (for example) that <em>a
line is made by the motion of a point, superficies
by the motion of a line</em>, and <em>one motion by another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>motion</em>, &#38;c. It remains, that we enquire what
motion begets such and such effects; as, what
motion makes a straight line, and what a circular;
what motion thrusts, what draws, and by what
way; what makes a thing which is seen or heard,
to be seen or heard sometimes in one manner,
sometimes in another. Now the method of this
kind of enquiry, is <em>compositive</em>. For first we are
to observe what effect a body moved produceth,
when we consider nothing in it besides its motion;
and we see presently that this makes a line, or
length; next, what the motion of a long body
produces, which we find to be superficies; and so
forwards, till we see what the effects of simple
motion are; and then, in like manner, we are to
observe what proceeds from the addition, multiplication,
subtraction, and division, of these motions,
and what effects, what figures, and what properties,
they produce; from which kind of contemplation
sprung that part of philosophy which is called
<em>geometry</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this consideration of what is produced by
simple motion, we are to pass to the consideration
of what effects one body moved worketh upon
another; and because there may be motion in all
the several parts of a body, yet so as that the
whole body remain still in the same place, we
must enquire first, what motion causeth such and
such motion in the whole, that is, when one body
invades another body which is either at rest or in
motion, what way, and with what swiftness, the
invaded body shall move; and, again, what motion
this second body will generate in a third, and so
forwards. From which contemplation shall be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>drawn that part of philosophy which treats of
motion.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the third place we must proceed to the
enquiry of such effects as are made by the motion
of the parts of any body, as, how it comes to
pass, that things when they are the same, yet
seem not to be the same, but changed. And here
the things we search after are sensible qualities,
such as <em>light</em>, <em>colour</em>, <em>transparency</em>, <em>opacity</em>,
<em>sound</em>, <em>odour</em>, <em>savour</em>, <em>heat</em>, <em>cold</em>, and the like;
which because they cannot be known till we
know the causes of sense itself, therefore the
consideration of the causes of <em>seeing</em>, <em>hearing</em>,
<em>smelling</em>, <em>tasting</em>, and <em>touching</em>, belongs to this
third place; and all those qualities and changes,
above mentioned, are to be referred to the fourth
place; which two considerations comprehend
that part of philosophy which is called <em>physics</em>.
And in these four parts is contained whatsoever
in natural philosophy may be explicated by
demonstration, properly so called. For if a cause
were to be rendered of natural appearances in
special, as, what are the motions and influences of
the heavenly bodies, and of their parts, the reason
hereof must either be drawn from the parts of the
sciences above mentioned, or no reason at all will
be given, but all left to uncertain conjecture.</p>

<p class='c001'>After <em>physics</em> we must come to <em>moral philosophy</em>;
in which we are to consider the motions
of the mind, namely, <em>appetite</em>, <em>aversion</em>, <em>love</em>,
<em>benevolence</em>, <em>hope</em>, <em>fear</em>, <em>anger</em>, <em>emulation</em>, <em>envy</em>,
<i>&#38;c.</i>; what causes they have, and of what they
be causes. And the reason why these are to
be considered after <em>physics</em> is, that they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>their causes in sense and imagination, which are
the subject of <em>physical</em> contemplation. Also the
reason, why all these things are to be searched
after in the order above-said, is, that physics
cannot be understood, except we know first what
motions are in the smallest parts of bodies; nor
such motion of parts, till we know what it is that
makes another body move; nor this, till we know
what simple motion will effect. And because all
appearance of things to sense is determined, and
made to be of such and such quality and quantity
by compounded motions, every one of which has a
certain degree of velocity, and a certain and
determined way; therefore, in the first place, <a id='corr73.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='we we'>we</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_73.14'><ins class='correction' title='we we'>we</ins></a></span>
are to search out the ways of motion simply
(in which geometry consists); next the ways of
such generated motions as are manifest; and,
lastly, the ways of internal and invisible motions
(which is the enquiry of natural philosophers).
And, therefore, they that study natural philosophy,
study in vain, except they begin at geometry;
and such writers or disputers thereof, as are
ignorant of geometry, do but make their readers
and hearers lose their time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>That method of civil and natural science, proceeding from sense to principles, is analytical; and again, that which begins at principles is synthetical.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.7'></a>7. <em>Civil</em> and <em>moral philosophy</em> do not so adhere
to one another, but that they may be severed.
For the causes of the motions of the mind are
known, not only by ratiocination, but also by the
experience of every man that takes the pains to
observe those motions within himself. And,
therefore, not only they that have attained the
knowledge of the passions and perturbations of
the mind, by the <em>synthetical method</em>, and from
the very first principles of philosophy, may by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>proceeding in the same way, come to the causes
and necessity of constituting commonwealths, and
to get the knowledge of what is natural right, and
what are civil duties; and, in every kind of
government, what are the rights of the commonwealth,
and all other knowledge appertaining to
civil philosophy; for this reason, that the principles
of the politics consist in the knowledge of
the motions of the mind, and the knowledge of
these motions from the knowledge of sense and
imagination; but even they also that have not
learned the first part of philosophy, namely,
<em>geometry</em> and <em>physics</em>, may, notwithstanding,
attain the principles of civil philosophy, by the
<em>analytical method</em>. For if a question be propounded,
as, <em>whether such an action be just or
unjust</em>; if that <em>unjust</em> be resolved into <em>fact against
law</em>, and that notion <em>law</em> into the <em>command</em> of him
or them that have <em>coercive power</em>; and that
<em>power</em> be derived from the <em>wills</em> of men that constitute
such power, to the end they may live in
peace, they may at last come to this, that the
appetites of men and the passions of their minds
are such, that, unless they be restrained by some
power, they will always be making war upon one
another; which may be known to be so by any
man's experience, that will but examine his own
mind. And, therefore, from hence he may proceed,
by compounding, to the determination of
the justice or injustice of any propounded action.
So that it is manifest, by what has been said, that
the method of philosophy, to such as seek science
simply, without propounding to themselves the
solution of any particular question, is partly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>analytical, and partly synthetical; namely, that
which proceeds from sense to the invention of
principles, analytical; and the rest synthetical.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The method of searching out, whether anything propounded be matter or accident.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.8'></a>8. To those that seek the cause of some certain
and propounded appearance or effect, it happens,
sometimes, that they know not whether the thing,
whose cause is sought after, be matter or body, or
some accident of a body. For though in geometry,
when the cause is sought of magnitude, or proportion,
or figure, it be certainly known that these
things, namely magnitude, proportion, and figure,
are accidents; yet in natural philosophy, where all
questions are concerning the causes of the phantasms
of sensible things, it is not so easy to
discern between the things themselves, from which
those phantasms proceed, and the appearances of
those things to the sense; which have deceived
many, especially when the phantasms have been
made by light. For example, a man that looks
upon the sun, has a certain shining idea of the
magnitude of about a foot over, and this he calls
the sun, though he know the sun to be truly a
great deal bigger; and, in like manner, the phantasm
of the same thing appears sometimes round,
by being seen afar off, and sometimes square, by
being nearer. Whereupon it may well be doubted,
whether that phantasm be matter, or some body
natural, or only some accident of a body; in the examination
of which doubt we may use this method.
The properties of matter and accidents already
found out by us, by the synthetical method, from
their definitions, are to be compared with the idea
we have before us; and if it agree with the properties
of matter or body, then it is a body; otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>it is an accident. Seeing, therefore, matter
cannot by any endeavour of ours be either made or
destroyed, or increased, or diminished, or moved
out of its place, whereas that idea appears, vanishes,
is increased and diminished, and moved hither and
thither at pleasure; we may certainly conclude
that it is not a body, but an accident only. And
this method is <em>synthetical</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The method of seeking whether any accident be in this or in that subject.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.9'></a>9. But if there be a doubt made concerning the
subject of any known accident (for this may be
doubted sometimes, as in the precedent example,
doubt may be made in what subject that splendour
and apparent magnitude of the sun is), then our
enquiry must proceed in this manner. First,
matter in general must be divided into parts,
as, into object, medium, and the sentient itself, or
such other parts as seem most conformable to the
thing propounded. Next, these parts are severally
to be examined how they agree with the definition
of the subject; and such of them as are not
capable of that accident are to be rejected. For
example, if by any true ratiocination the sun be
found to be greater than its apparent magnitude,
then that magnitude is not in the sun; if the sun
be in one determined straight line, and one determined
distance, and the magnitude and splendour
be seen in more lines and distances than one, as it
is in reflection or refraction, then neither that
splendour nor apparent magnitude are in the sun
itself, and, therefore, the body of the sun cannot
be the subject of that splendour and magnitude.
And for the same reasons the air and other parts
will be rejected, till at last nothing remain which
can be the subject of that splendour and magnitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>but the sentient itself. And this method,
in regard the subject is divided into parts, is
analytical; and in regard the properties, both of
the subject and accident, are compared with the
accident concerning whose subject the enquiry is
made, it is synthetical.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Method of searching for the cause of any effect, propounded.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.10'></a>10. But when we seek after the cause of any
propounded effect, we must in the first place get
into our mind an exact notion or idea of that
which we call cause, namely, that <i>a cause is the
sum or aggregate of all such accidents, both in
the agents and the patient, as concur to the
producing of the effect propounded; all which
existing together, it cannot be understood but
that the effect existeth with them; or that
it can possibly exist if any one of them be
absent</i>. This being known, in the next place we
must examine singly every accident that accompanies
or precedes the effect, as far forth as it
seems to conduce in any manner to the production
of the same, and see whether the propounded
effect may be conceived to exist, without the
existence of any of those accidents; and by this
means separate such accidents, as do not concur,
from such as concur to produce the said effect;
which being done, we are to put together the
concurring accidents, and consider whether we
can possibly conceive, that when these are all
present, the effect propounded will not follow;
and if it be evident that the effect will follow,
then that aggregate of accidents is the entire
cause, otherwise not; but we must still search out
and put together other accidents. For example,
if the cause of light be propounded to be sought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>out; first, we examine things without us, and find
that whensoever light appears, there is some principal
object, as it were the fountain of light,
without which we cannot have any perception of
light; and, therefore, the concurrence of that
object is necessary to the generation of light.
Next we consider the medium, and find, that
unless it be disposed in a certain manner, namely,
that it be transparent, though the object remain
the same, yet the effect will not follow; and,
therefore, the concurrence of transparency is also
necessary to the generation of light. Thirdly, we
observe our own body, and find that by the indisposition
of the eyes, the brain, the nerves, and the
heart, that is, by obstructions, stupidity, and
debility, we are deprived of light, so that a fitting
disposition of the organs to receive impressions
from without is likewise a necessary part of the
cause of light. Again, of all the accidents inherent
in the object, there is none that can conduce to
the effecting of light, but only action (or a certain
motion), which cannot be conceived to be wanting,
whensoever the effect is present; for, that anything
may shine, it is not requisite that it be of such or
such magnitude or figure, or that the whole
body of it be moved out of the place it is in (unless
it may perhaps be said, that in the sun, or other
body, that which causes light is the light it hath
in itself; which yet is but a trifling exception,
seeing nothing is meant thereby but the cause of
light; as if any man should say that the cause of
light is that in the sun which produceth it); it
remains, therefore, that the action, by which light
is generated, is motion only in the parts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>object. Which being understood, we may easily
conceive what it is the medium contributes,
namely, the continuation of that motion to the
eye; and, lastly, what the eye and the rest of the
organs of the sentient contribute, namely, the
continuation of the same motion to the last organ
of sense, the heart. And in this manner the cause
of light may be made up of motion continued
from the original of the same motion, to the
original of vital motion, light being nothing but
the alteration of vital motion, made by the impression
upon it of motion continued from the object.
But I give this only for an example, for I shall
speak more at large of light, and the generation of
it, in its proper place. In the mean time it is
manifest, that in the searching out of causes, there
is need partly of the analytical, and partly of the
synthetical method; of the analytical, to conceive
how circumstances conduce severally to the
production of effects; and of the synthetical, for
the adding together and compounding of what they
can effect singly by themselves. And thus much
may serve for the method of invention. It remains
that I speak of the method of teaching, that is, of
demonstration, and of the means by which we
demonstrate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Words serve to invention as marks; to demonstration as signs.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.11'></a>11. In the method of invention, the use of
words consists in this, that they may serve for
marks, by which, whatsoever we have found out
may be recalled to memory; for without this all
our inventions perish, nor will it be possible for
us to go on from principles beyond a syllogism
or two, by reason of the weakness of memory.
For example, if any man, by considering a triangle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>set before him, should find that all its angles
together taken are equal to two right angles, and
that by thinking of the same tacitly, without any
use of words either understood or expressed; and
it should happen afterwards that another triangle,
unlike the former, or the same in different situation,
should be offered to his consideration, he
would not know readily whether the same property
were in this last or no, but would be forced,
as often as a different triangle were brought before
him (and the difference of triangles is infinite) to
begin his contemplation anew; which he would
have no need to do if he had the use of names,
for every universal name denotes the conceptions
we have of infinite singular things. Nevertheless,
as I said above, they serve as <em>marks</em> for the help
of our memory, whereby we register to ourselves
our own inventions; but not as <em>signs</em> by which
we declare the same to others; so that a man may
be a philosopher alone by himself, without any
master; Adam had this capacity. But to teach,
that is, to demonstrate, supposes two at the least,
and syllogistical speech.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The method of demonstration is synthetical.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.12'></a>12. And seeing teaching is nothing but leading
the mind of him we teach, to the knowledge of
our inventions, in that track by which we attained
the same with our own mind; therefore, the same
method that served for our invention, will serve
also for demonstration to others, saving that we
omit the first part of method which proceeded
from the sense of things to universal principles,
which, because they are principles, cannot be
demonstrated; and seeing they are known by
nature, (as was said above in the 5th article) they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>need no demonstration, though they need explication.
The whole method, therefore, of demonstration,
is <em>synthetical</em>, consisting of that order of
speech which begins from primary or most
universal propositions, which are manifest of
themselves, and proceeds by a perpetual composition
of propositions into syllogisms, till at
last the learner understand the truth of the
conclusion sought after.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Definitions only are primary, &#38; universal propositions.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.13'></a>13. Now, such principles are nothing but definitions,
whereof there are two sorts; one of
names, that signify such things as have some conceivable
cause, and another of such names as
signify things of which we can conceive no cause
at all. Names of the former kind are, <em>body</em>, or
<em>matter</em>, <em>quantity</em>, or <em>extension</em>, <em>motion</em>, and whatsoever
is common to all matter. Of the second
kind, are <em>such a body</em>, <em>such and so great motion</em>,
<em>so great magnitude</em>, <em>such figure</em>, and whatsoever
we can distinguish one body from another by.
And names of the former kind are well enough
defined, when, by speech as short as may be, we
raise in the mind of the hearer perfect and clear
ideas or conceptions of the things named, as when
we define motion to be <em>the leaving of one place,
and the acquiring of another continually</em>; for
though no thing moved, nor any cause of motion
be in that definition, yet, at the hearing of that
speech, there will come into the mind of the
hearer an <em>idea</em> of motion clear enough. But
definitions of things, which may be understood to
have some cause, must consist of such names as
express the cause or manner of their generation,
as when we define a circle to be a figure made by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the circumduction of a straight line in a plane, &#38;c.
Besides definitions, there is no other proposition
that ought to be called primary, or (according
to severe truth) be received into the number of
principles. For those <em>axioms of Euclid</em>, seeing
they may be demonstrated, are no principles of
demonstration, though they have by the consent of
all men gotten the authority of principles, because
they need not be demonstrated. Also, those
<em>petitions</em>, or <em>postulata</em>, (as they call them) though
they be principles, yet they are not principles of
demonstration, but of construction only; that is,
not of science, but of power; or (which is all one)
not of <em>theorems</em>, which are speculations, but of
<em>problems</em>, which belong to practice, or the doing
of something. But as for those common received
opinions, <em>Nature abhors vacuity</em>, <em>Nature doth
nothing in vain</em>, and the like, which are neither
evident in themselves, nor at all to be demonstrated,
and which are oftener false than true,
they are much less to be acknowledged for
principles.</p>

<p class='c001'>To return, therefore, to definitions; the reason
why I say that the cause and generation of such
things, as have any cause or generation, ought to
enter into their definitions, is this. The end of
science is the demonstration of the causes and
generations of things; which if they be not in the
definitions, they cannot be found in the conclusion
of the first syllogism, that is made from those
definitions; and if they be not in the first conclusion,
they will not be found in any further
conclusion deduced from that; and, therefore, by
proceeding in this manner, we shall never come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>science; which is against the scope and intention
of demonstration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The nature &#38; definition of a definition.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.14'></a>14. Now, seeing definitions (as I have said) are
principles, or primary propositions, they are therefore
speeches; and seeing they are used for the
raising of an <em>idea</em> of some thing in the mind of
the learner, whensoever that thing has a name,
the definition of it can be nothing but the explication
of that name by speech; and if that name
be given it for some compounded conception, the
definition is nothing but a resolution of that name
into its most universal parts. As when we define
man, saying <em>man is a body animated, sentient,
rational</em>, those names, <em>body animated</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i> are
parts of that whole name <em>man</em>; so that definitions
of this kind always consist of <em>genus</em> and <em>difference</em>;
the former names being all, till the last, <em>general</em>;
and the last of all, <em>difference</em>. But if any name
be the most universal in its kind, then the definition
of it cannot consist of <em>genus</em> and <em>difference</em>,
but is to be made by such circumlocution, as best
explicateth the force of that name. Again, it is
possible, and happens often, that the <em>genus</em> and
<em>difference</em> are put together, and yet make no
definition; as these words, <em>a straight line</em>, contain
both the <em>genus</em> and <em>difference</em>; but are not a
definition, unless we should think a straight line
may be thus defined, <em>a straight line is a straight
line</em>: and yet if there were added another name,
consisting of different words, but signifying the
same thing which these signify, then these might
be the definition of that name. From what has
been said, it may be understood how a definition
ought to be defined, namely, <em>that it is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>proposition, whose predicate resolves the subject,
when it may; and when it may not, it exemplifies
the same</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Properties of a definition.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.15'></a>15. The properties of a definition are:</p>

<p class='c001'>First, that it takes away equivocation, as also
all that multitude of distinctions, which are used
by such as think they may learn philosophy by
disputation. For the nature of a definition is to
define, that is, to determine the signification of
the defined name, and to pare from it all other
signification besides what is contained in the
definition itself; and therefore one definition does
as much, as all the distinctions (how many soever)
that can be used about the name defined.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, that it gives an universal notion of
the thing defined, representing a certain universal
picture thereof, not to the eye, but to the mind.
For as when one paints a man, he paints the image
of some man; so he, that defines the name man,
makes a representation of some man to the mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, that it is not necessary to dispute
whether definitions are to be admitted or no. For
when a master is instructing his scholar, if the
scholar understand all the parts of the thing
defined, which are resolved in the definition, and
yet will not admit of the definition, there needs no
further controversy betwixt them, it being all one
as if he refused to be taught. But if he understand
nothing, then certainly the definition is
faulty; for the nature of a definition consists in
this, that it exhibit a clear idea of the thing defined;
and principles are either known by themselves, or
else they are not principles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fourthly, that, in philosophy, definitions are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>before defined names. For in teaching philosophy,
the first beginning is from definitions; and all progression
in the same, till we come to the knowledge
of the thing compounded, is compositive. Seeing,
therefore, definition is the explication of a compounded
name by resolution, and the progression
is from the parts to the compound, definitions
must be understood before compounded names;
nay, when the names of the parts of any speech
be explicated, it is not necessary that the definition
should be a name compounded of them. For
example, when these names, <em>equilateral</em>, <em>quadrilateral</em>,
<em>right-angled</em>, are sufficiently understood,
it is not necessary in geometry that there should
be at all such a name as <em>square</em>; for defined
names are received in philosophy for brevity's
sake only.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fifthly, that compounded names, which are defined
one way in some one part of philosophy,
may in another part of the same be otherwise
defined; as a <em>parabola</em> and an <em>hyperbole</em> have
one definition in geometry, and another in rhetoric;
for definitions are instituted and serve for the
understanding of the doctrine which is treated of.
And, therefore, as in one part of philosophy, a
definition may have in it some one fit name for
the more brief explanation of some proposition in
geometry; so it may have the same liberty in
other parts of philosophy; for the use of names is
particular (even where many agree to the settling
of them) and arbitrary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sixthly, that no name can be defined by any
one word; because no one word is sufficient for
the resolving of one or more words.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Seventhly, that a defined name ought not to be
repeated in the definition. For a defined name is
the whole compound, and a definition is the resolution
of that compound into parts; but no total
can be part of itself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nature of a demonstration.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.16'></a>16. Any two definitions, that may be compounded
into a syllogism, produce a conclusion;
which, because it is derived from principles, that
is, from definitions, is said to be demonstrated;
and the derivation or composition itself is called a
demonstration. In like manner, if a syllogism be
made of two propositions, whereof one is a definition,
the other a demonstrated conclusion, or
neither of them is a definition, but both formerly
demonstrated, that syllogism is also called a demonstration,
and so successively. The definition
therefore of a demonstration is this, <em>a demonstration
is a syllogism, or series of syllogisms,
derived and continued, from the definitions of
names, to the last conclusion</em>. And from hence it
may be understood, that all true ratiocination,
which taketh its beginning from true principles,
produceth science, and is true demonstration.
For as for the original of the name, although that,
which the Greeks called ἀποδέιξις, and the Latins
<span lang="la"><i>demonstratio</i></span>, was understood by them for that
sort only of ratiocination, in which, by the describing
of certain lines and figures, they placed
the thing they were to prove, as it were before
men's eyes, which is properly ἀποδεικνύειν, or to
<em>shew</em> by the figure; yet they seem to have done it
for this reason, that unless it were in geometry,
(in which only there is place for such figures)
there was no ratiocination certain, and ending in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>science, their doctrines concerning all other things
being nothing but controversy and clamour;
which, nevertheless, happened, not because the
truth to which they pretended could not be made
evident without figures, but because they wanted
true principles, from which they might derive
their ratiocination; and, therefore, there is no
reason but that if true definitions were premised
in all sorts of doctrines, the demonstrations also
would be true.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Properties of a demonstration, and order of things to be demonstrated.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.17'></a>17. It. is proper to methodical demonstration,</p>

<p class='c001'>First, that there be a true succession of one
reason to another, according to the rules of syllogizing
delivered above.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, that the premises of all syllogisms be
demonstrated from the first definitions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, that after definitions, he that teaches
or demonstrates any thing, proceed in the same
method by which he found it out; namely, that
in the first place those things be demonstrated,
which immediately succeed to universal definitions
(in which is contained that part of philosophy
which is called <span lang="la"><i>philosophia prima</i></span>). Next, those
things which may be demonstrated by simple
motion (in which geometry consists). After
geometry, such things as may be taught or shewed
by manifest action, that is, by thrusting from, or
pulling towards. And after these, the motion or
mutation of the invisible parts of things, and the
doctrine of sense and imaginations, and of the
internal passions, especially those of men, in which
are comprehended the grounds of civil duties, or
civil philosophy; which takes up the last place.
And that this method ought to be kept in all sorts of
philosophy, is evident from hence, that such things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>as I have said are to be taught last, cannot be demonstrated,
till such as are propounded to be first
treated of, be fully understood. Of which method
no other example can be given, but that treatise
of the elements of philosophy, which I shall begin
in the next chapter, and continue to the end of
the work.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Faults of a demonstration.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.18'></a>18. Besides those <em>paralogisms</em>, whose fault lies
either in the falsity of the premises, or the want
of true composition, of which I have spoken in
the precedent chapter, there are two more, which
are frequent in demonstration; one whereof is
commonly called <span lang="la"><i>petitio principii</i></span>; the other is
the supposing of a <em>false cause</em>; and these do not
only deceive unskilful learners, but sometimes
masters themselves, by making them take that for
well demonstrated, which is not demonstrated at
all. <span lang="la"><i>Petitio principii</i></span> is, when the conclusion to
be proved is disguised in other words, and put
for the definition or principle from whence it is
to be demonstrated; and thus, by putting for the
cause of the thing sought, either the thing itself or
some effect of it, they make a circle in their
demonstration. As for example, he that would
demonstrate that the earth stands still in the
centre of the world, and should suppose the earth's
gravity to be the cause thereof, and define gravity
to be a quality by which every heavy body tends
towards the centre of the world, would lose his
labour; for the question is, what is the cause of
that quality in the earth? and, therefore, he that
supposes gravity to be the cause, puts the thing
itself for its own cause.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of a <em>false cause</em> I find this example in a certain
treatise where the thing to be demonstrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>is the motion of the earth. He begins, therefore,
with this, that seeing the earth and the sun are
not always in the same situation, it must needs be
that one of them be locally moved, which is true;
next, he affirms that the vapours, which the sun
raises from the earth and sea, are, by reason of
this motion, necessarily moved, which also is true;
from whence he infers the winds are made, and
this may pass for granted; and by these winds he
says, the waters of the sea are moved, and by
their motion the bottom of the sea, as if it were
beaten forwards, moves round; and let this also
be granted; wherefore, he concludes, the earth is
moved; which is, nevertheless, a paralogism. For,
if that wind were the cause why the earth was,
from the beginning, moved round, and the motion
either of the sun or the earth were the cause of
that wind, then the motion of the sun or the earth
was before the wind itself; and if the earth were
moved, before the wind was made, then the wind
could not be the cause of the earth's revolution;
but, if the sun were moved, and the earth stand
still, then it is manifest the earth might remain
unmoved, notwithstanding that wind; and therefore
that motion was not made by the cause which
he allegeth. But paralogisms of this kind are
very frequent among the writers of <em>physics</em>,
though none can be more elaborate than this in
the example given.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Why the analytical method of geometricians cannot be treated of in this place.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art6.19'></a>19. It may to some men seem pertinent to treat
in this place of that art of the geometricians,
which they call <span lang="la"><i>logistica</i></span>, that is, the art, by
which, from supposing the thing in question to be
true, they proceed by ratiocination, till either they
come to something known, by which they may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>demonstrate the truth of the thing sought for; or
to something which is impossible, from whence
they collect that to be false, which they supposed
true. But this art cannot be explicated here, for
this reason, that the method of it can neither be
practised, nor understood, unless by such as are
well versed in geometry; and among geometricians
themselves, they, that have most theorems in
readiness, are the most ready in the use of this
<span lang="la"><i>logistica</i></span>; so that, indeed, it is not a distinct
thing from geometry itself; for there are, in the
method of it, three parts; the first whereof consists
in the finding out of equality betwixt known
and unknown things, which they call equation;
and this equation cannot be found out, but by such
as know perfectly the nature, properties, and
transpositions of proportion, as also the addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division of lines
and superficies, and the extraction of roots; which
are the parts of no mean geometrician. The
second is, when an equation is found, to be able to
judge whether the truth or falsity of the question
may be deduced from it, or no; which yet requires
greater knowledge. And the third is, when such
an equation is found, as is fit for the solution of
the question, to know how to resolve the same in
such manner, that the truth or falsity may thereby
manifestly appear; which, in hard questions,
cannot be done without the knowledge of the
nature of crooked-lined figures; but he that understands
readily the nature and properties of
these, is a complete geometrician. It happens
besides, that for the finding out of equations, there
is no certain method, but he is best able to do it,
that has the best natural wit.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Things that have no existence, may nevertheless be understood and computed.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.1'></a>1. In the teaching of natural philosophy, I cannot
begin better (as I have already shewn) than from
<em>privation</em>; that is, from feigning the world to be
annihilated. But, if such annihilation of all things
be supposed, it may perhaps be asked, what would
remain for any man (whom only I except from
this universal annihilation of things) to consider
as the subject of philosophy, or at all to reason
upon; or what to give names unto for ratiocination's
sake.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>I say, therefore, there would remain to that man
ideas of the world, and of all such bodies as he
had, before their annihilation, seen with his eyes,
or perceived by any other sense; that is to say,
the memory and imagination of magnitudes,
motions, sounds, colours, &#38;c. as also of their order
and parts. All which things, though they be
nothing but ideas and phantasms, happening internally
to him that imagineth; yet they will
appear as if they were external, and not at all
depending upon any power of the mind. And
these are the things to which he would give
names, and subtract them from, and compound
them with one another. For seeing, that after the
destruction of all other things, I suppose man
still remaining, and namely that he thinks, imagines,
and remembers, there can be nothing for
him to think of but what is past; nay, if we do
but observe diligently what it is we do when we
consider and reason, we shall find, that though
all things be still remaining in the world, yet we
compute nothing but our own phantasms. For
when we calculate the magnitude and motions of
heaven or earth, we do not ascend into heaven
that we may divide it into parts, or measure the
motions thereof, but we do it sitting still in our
closets or in the dark. Now things may be considered,
that is, be brought into account, either as
internal accidents of our mind, in which manner
we consider them when the question is about
some faculty of the mind; or as species of external
things, not as really existing, but appearing only
to exist, or to have a being without us. And in
this manner we are now to consider them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is Space.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span><a id='art7.2'></a>2. If therefore we remember, or have a phantasm
of any thing that was in the world before the
supposed annihilation of the same; and consider,
not that the thing was such or such, but only that
it had a being without the mind, we have presently
a conception of that we call <em>space</em>: an
imaginary space indeed, because a mere phantasm,
yet that very thing which all men call so. For no
man calls it space for being already filled, but
because it may be filled; nor does any man
think bodies carry their places away with them,
but that the same space contains sometimes one,
sometimes another body; which could not be if
space should always accompany the body which is
once in it. And this is of itself so manifest, that
I should not think it needed any explaining at all,
but that I find space to be falsely defined by
certain philosophers, who infer from thence, one,
that the world is infinite (for taking <em>space</em> to be
the extension of bodies, and thinking extension
may encrease continually, he infers that bodies
may be infinitely extended); and, another, from the
same definition, concludes rashly, that it is impossible
even to God himself to create more
worlds than one; for, if another world were to be
created, he says, that seeing there is nothing
without this world, and therefore (according to his
definition) no space, that new world must be
placed in nothing; but in nothing nothing can be
placed; which he affirms only, without showing
any reason for the same; whereas the contrary is
the truth: for more cannot be put into a place
already filled, so much is empty space fitter than
that, which is full, for the receiving of new bodies.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Having therefore spoken thus much for these
men's sakes, and for theirs that assent to them,
I return to my purpose, and define <em>space</em> thus:
<span class='fss'>SPACE</span> <em>is the phantasm of a thing existing without
the mind simply</em>; that is to say, that phantasm,
in which we consider no other accident, but only
that it appears without us.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Time.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.3'></a>3. As a body leaves a phantasm of its magnitude
in the mind, so also a moved body leaves a
phantasm of its motion, namely, an idea of that
body passing out of one space into another by
continual succession. And this idea, or phantasm,
is that, which (without receding much from the
common opinion, or from <i>Aristotle's</i> definition)
I call <em>Time</em>. For seeing all men confess a year
to be time, and yet do not think a year to be
the accident or affection of any body, they must
needs confess it to be, not in the things without
us, but only in the thought of the mind. So
when they speak of the times of their predecessors,
they do not think after their predecessors are
gone, that their times can be any where else than
in the memory of those that remember them.
And as for those that say, days, years, and months
are the motions of the sun and moon, seeing it is
all one to say, motion <em>past</em> and motion <em>destroyed</em>,
and that <em>future</em> motion is the same with motion
which <em>is not yet begun</em>, they say that, which they
do not mean, that there neither is, nor has been,
nor shall be any time: for of whatsoever it may
be said, <em>it has been</em> or <em>it shall be</em>, of the same
also it might have been said heretofore, or may
be said hereafter, <em>it is</em>. What then can days,
months, and years, be, but the names of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>computations made in our mind? <em>Time</em> therefore
is a phantasm, but a phantasm of motion, for if
we would know by what moments time passes
away, we make use of some motion or other, as
of the sun, of a clock, of the sand in an hour-glass,
or we mark some line upon which we
imagine something to be moved, there being no
other means by which we can take notice of any
time at all. And yet, when I say <em>time</em> is a phantasm
of motion, I do not say this is sufficient to
define it by; for this word <em>time</em> comprehends the
notion of <em>former</em> and <em>latter</em>, or of <em>succession</em>
in the motion of a body, in as much as it is first
<em>here</em> then <em>there</em>. Wherefore a complete definition
of <em>time</em> is such as this, <span class='fss'>TIME</span> <em>is the phantasm of
before and after in motion</em>; which agrees with
this definition of <em>Aristotle</em>, <em>time is the number of
motion according to former and latter</em>; for that
numbering is an act of the mind; and therefore
it is all one to say, <em>time is the number of motion
according to former and latter</em>; and <em>time is a
phantasm of motion numbered</em>. But that other
definition, <em>time is the measure of motion</em>, is not
so exact, for we measure time by motion and
not motion by time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Part.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.4'></a>4. One space is called <em>part</em> of another space,
and one time <em>part</em> of another time, when this
contains that and something besides. From
whence it may be collected, that nothing can
rightly be called a <span class='fss'>PART</span>, but that which is compared
with something that contains it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Division.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.5'></a>5. And therefore to <em>make parts</em>, or to <em>part</em> or
<span class='fss'>DIVIDE</span> space or <em>time</em>, is nothing else but to consider
one and another within the same; so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>if any man <em>divide</em> space or time, the diverse
conceptions he has are more, by one, than the
parts he makes; for his first conception is of that
which is to be divided, then of some part of it,
and again of some other part of it, and so
forwards as long as he goes on in dividing.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is to be noted, that here, by <em>division</em>, I
do not mean the severing or pulling asunder of
one space or time from another (for does any
man think that one hemisphere may be separated
from the other hemisphere, or the first hour from
the second?) but diversity of consideration; so
that division is not made by the operation of the
hands but of the mind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>One.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.6'></a>6. When space or time is considered among
other spaces or times, it is said to be <span class='fss'>ONE</span>, namely
<em>one of them</em>; for except one space might be
added to another, and subtracted from another
space, and so of time, it would be sufficient to
say space or time simply, and superfluous to say
one space or one time, if it could not be conceived
that there were another. The common definition
of <em>one</em>, namely, that <em>one is that which is undivided</em>,
is obnoxious to an absurd consequence; for it may
thence be inferred, that whatsoever is divided is
many things, that is, that every divided thing, is
divided things, which is insignificant.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Number.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.7'></a>7. <span class='fss'>NUMBER</span> is <em>one</em> and <em>one</em>, or <em>one one</em> and <em>one</em>,
and so forwards; namely, <em>one</em> and <em>one</em> make the
number <em>two</em>, and <em>one one</em> and <em>one</em> the number
<em>three</em>; so are all other numbers made; which is
all one as if we should say, <em>number is unities</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Composition.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.8'></a>8. To <span class='fss'>COMPOUND</span> space of spaces, or time of
times, is first to consider them one after another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and then altogether as one; as if one should
reckon first the head, the feet, the arms, and the
body, severally, and then for the account of them
all together put <em>man</em>. And that which is so put
for all the severals of which it consists, is called
the <span class='fss'>WHOLE</span>; and those severals, when by the
division of the whole they come again to be
considered singly, are parts thereof; and therefore
the <em>whole</em> and <em>all the parts taken together</em> are
the same thing. And as I noted above, that in
<em>division</em> it is not necessary to pull the parts
asunder; so in <em>composition</em>, it is to be understood,
that for the making up of a whole there is no
need of putting the parts together, so as to make
them touch one another, but only of collecting
them into one sum in the mind. For thus all men,
being considered together, make up the whole of
mankind, though never so much dispersed by time
and place; and twelve hours, though the hours of
several days, may be compounded into one number
of twelve.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The whole.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.9'></a>9. This being well understood, it is manifest,
that nothing can rightly be called a whole, that is
not conceived to be compounded of parts, and that
it may be divided into parts; so that if we deny
that a thing has parts, we deny the same to be a
whole. For example, if we say the soul can have
no parts, we affirm that no soul can be a whole
soul. Also it is manifest, that nothing has parts
till it be divided; and when a thing is divided,
the parts are only so many as the division makes
them. Again, that a part of a part is a part of
the whole; and thus any part of the number <em>four</em>,
as <em>two</em>, is a part of the number <em>eight</em>; for <em>four</em> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>made of <em>two</em> and <em>two</em>; but <em>eight</em> is compounded
of <em>two</em>, <em>two</em>, and <em>four</em>, and therefore <em>two</em>, which
is a part of the part <em>four</em>, is also a part of the
whole <em>eight</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Spaces and times contiguous and continual.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.10'></a>10. Two spaces are said to be <span class='fss'>CONTIGUOUS</span>,
when there is no other space betwixt them. But
two times, betwixt which there is no other time, are
called immediate, as A B, B C.<span class='sni illus'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='under'>A&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;B&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And any two spaces, as well as
times, are said to be <span class='fss'>CONTINUAL</span>, when they have
one common part, as A C, B D,
where the part B C is common;
<span class='sni illus'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='under'>A&#160;&#160;&#160;B&#160;&#160;&#160;C&#160;&#160;&#160;D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and more spaces and times are continual, when
every two which are next one another are
continual.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Beginning, end, way, finite, infinite.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.11'></a>11. That part which is between two other parts,
is called a <span class='fss'>MEAN</span>; and that which is not between
two other parts, an <span class='fss'>EXTREME</span>. And of extremes,
that which is first reckoned is the <span class='fss'>BEGINNING</span>,
and that which last, the <span class='fss'>END</span>; and all the means
together taken are the <span class='fss'>WAY</span>. Also, <em>extreme parts</em>
and <em>limits</em> are the same thing. And from hence
it is manifest, that <em>beginning</em> and <em>end</em> depend
upon the order in which we number them; and
that to <em>terminate</em> or <em>limit</em> space and time, is the
same thing with <em>imagining their beginning and
end</em>; as also that every thing is <span class='fss'>FINITE</span> or <span class='fss'>INFINITE</span>,
according as we imagine or not imagine it
<em>limited</em> or <em>terminated</em> every way; and that the
<em>limits</em> of any number are <em>unities</em>, and of these,
that which is the first in our numbering is the
<em>beginning</em>, and that which we number last, is the
<em>end</em>. When we say number is <em>infinite</em>, we mean
only that no number is expressed; for when we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>speak of the numbers <em>two</em>, <em>three</em>, <em>a thousand</em>, &#38;c.
they are always <em>finite</em>. But when no more is said
but this, <em>number is infinite</em>, it is to be understood
as if it were said, this name <em>number</em> is an <em>indefinite</em>
name.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is infinite in power. Nothing infinite can be truly said to be either whole or one; nor infinite spaces or times, many.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.12'></a>12. Space or time is said to <em>finite in power</em>,
or <em>terminable</em>, when there may be assigned a
number of finite spaces or times, as of paces or
hours, than which there can be no greater number
of the same measure in that space or time; and
<em>infinite in power</em> is that space or time, in which
a greater number of the said paces or hours may
be assigned, than any number that can be given.
But we must note, that, although in that space or
time which is infinite in power, there may be
numbered more paces or hours than any number
that can be assigned, yet their number will always
be finite; for every number is finite. And therefore
his ratiocination was not good, that undertaking
to prove the world to be finite, reasoned
thus; <em>If the world be infinite, then there may be
taken in it some part which is distant from us an
infinite number of paces: but no such part can
be taken; wherefore the world is not infinite</em>;
because that consequence of the major proposition
is false; for in an infinite space, whatsoever we take
or design in our mind, the distance of the same
from us is a finite space; for in the very designing
of the place thereof, we put an end to that space,
of which we ourselves are the beginning; and
whatsoever any man with his mind cuts off both
ways from infinite, he determines the same, that
is, he makes it finite.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of infinite space or time, it cannot be said that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>it is a <em>whole</em> or <em>one</em>: not a <em>whole</em>, because not
compounded of parts; for seeing parts, how many
soever they be, are severally finite, they will also,
when they are all put together, make a whole
finite: nor <em>one</em>, because nothing can be said to be
one, except there be another to compare it with;
but it cannot be conceived that there are two
spaces, or two times, infinite. Lastly, when we
make question whether the world be finite or
infinite, we have nothing in our mind answering
to the name <em>world</em>; for whatsoever we imagine,
is therefore finite, though our computation reach
the fixed stars, or the ninth or tenth, nay, the
thousandth sphere. The meaning of the question
is this only, whether God has actually made so
great an addition of body to body, as we are able
to make of space to space.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Division proceeds not to the least.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art7.13'></a>13. And, therefore, that which is commonly
said, that space and time may be divided infinitely,
is not to be so understood, as if there might be
any infinite or eternal division; but rather to be
taken in this sense, <em>whatsoever is divided, is
divided into such parts as may again be divided</em>;
or thus, <em>the least divisible thing is not to be
given</em>; or, as geometricians have it, <em>no quantity
is so small, but a less may be taken</em>; which may
easily be demonstrated in this manner. Let any
space or time, that which was thought to be the
least divisible, be divided into two equal parts, A
and B. I say either of them, as A, may be
divided again. For suppose the part A to be
contiguous to the part B of one side, and of the
other side to some other space equal to B. This
whole space, therefore, being greater than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>space given, is divisible. Wherefore, if it be
divided into two equal parts, the part in the
middle, which is A, will be also divided into two
equal parts; and therefore A was divisible.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Body defined.</div>

<p class='c006'><a id='art8.1'></a>1. Having understood what imaginary space is,
in which we supposed nothing remaining without
us, but all those things to be destroyed, that, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>existing heretofore, left images of themselves in
our minds; let us now suppose some one of those
things to be placed again in the world, or created
anew. It is necessary, therefore, that this new-created
or replaced thing do not only fill some
part of the space above mentioned, or be coincident
and coextended with it, but also that it have
no dependance upon our thought. And this is
that which, for the extension of it, we commonly
call <em>body</em>; and because it depends not upon our
thought, we say is <em>a thing subsisting of itself</em>;
as also <em>existing</em>, because without us; and, lastly,
it is called the <em>subject</em>, because it is so placed in
and <em>subjected</em> to imaginary space, that it may be
understood by reason, as well as perceived by
sense. The definition, therefore, of <em>body</em> may be
this, a <em>body is that, which having no dependance
upon our thought, is coincident or coextended
with some part of space</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Accident defined.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.2'></a>2. But what an <em>accident</em> is cannot so easily be
explained by any definition, as by examples. Let
us imagine, therefore, that a body fills any space,
or is coextended with it; that coextension is not
the coextended body: and, in like manner, let us
imagine that the same body is removed out of its
place; that removing is not the removed body: or
let us think the same not removed; that not
removing or rest is not the resting body. What,
then, are these things? They are <em>accidents</em> of
that body. But the thing in question is, <em>what is
an accident?</em> which is an enquiry after that which
we know already, and not that which we should
enquire after. For who does not always and in
the same manner understand him that says any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>thing is extended, or moved, or not moved? But
most men will have it be said that <em>an accident is
something</em>, namely, some part of a natural thing,
when, indeed, it is no part of the same. To satisfy
these men, as well as may be, they answer best
that define an <em>accident</em> to be <em>the manner by which
any body is conceived</em>; which is all one as if they
should say, <em>an accident is that faculty of any
body, by which it works in us a conception of
itself</em>. Which definition, though it be not an
answer to the question propounded, yet it is an
answer to that question which should have been
propounded, namely, <em>whence does it happen that
one part of any body appears here, another
there?</em> For this is well answered thus: <em>it happens
from the extension of that body</em>. Or, <em>how comes
it to pass that the whole body, by succession, is
seen now here, now there?</em> and the answer will be,
<em>by reason of its motion</em>. Or, lastly, <em>whence is it
that any body possesseth the same space for
sometime?</em> and the answer will be, <em>because it is
not moved</em>. For if concerning the name of a
body, that is, concerning a concrete name, it be
asked, <em>what is it?</em> the answer must be made by
definition; for the question is concerning the
signification of the name. But if it be asked
concerning an abstract name, <em>what is it?</em> the
cause is demanded why a thing appears so or so.
As if it be asked, <em>what is hard?</em> The answer
will be, hard is that, whereof no part gives place,
but when the whole gives place. But if it be
demanded, <em>what is hardness?</em> a cause must be
shewn why a part does not give place, except the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>whole give place. Wherefore, I define an <em>accident</em>
to be <em>the manner of our conception of body</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How an accident may be understood to be in its subject.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.3'></a>3. When an <em>accident</em> is said <em>to be in a body</em>, it
is not so to be understood, as if any thing were
contained in that body; as if, for example, redness
were in blood, in the same manner, as blood is in
a bloody cloth, that is, as a part in the whole;
for so, an accident would be a body also. But, as
magnitude, or rest, or motion, is in that which is
great, or which resteth, or which is moved, (which,
how it is to be understood, every man understands)
so also, it is to be understood, that every other
accident <em>is in</em> its subject. And this, also, is
explicated by <em>Aristotle</em> no otherwise than negatively,
namely, that <em>an accident is in its subject,
not as any part thereof, but so as that it may be
away, the subject still remaining</em>; which is right,
saving that there are certain accidents which can
never perish except the body perish also; for no
body can be conceived to be without extension, or
without figure. All other accidents, which are
not common to all bodies, but peculiar to some
only, as <em>to be at rest</em>, <em>to be moved</em>, <em>colour</em>,
<em>hardness</em>, and the like, do perish continually, and
are succeeded by others; yet so, as that the body
never perisheth. And as for the opinion that some
may have, that all other accidents are not in their
bodies in the same manner that extension, motion,
rest, or figure, are in the same; for example, that
colour, heat, odour, virtue, vice, and the like, are
otherwise in them, and, as they say, <em>inherent</em>;
I desire they would suspend their judgment for
the present, and expect a little, till it be found out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>by ratiocination, whether these very accidents are
not also certain motions either of the mind of the
perceiver, or of the bodies themselves which are
perceived; for in the search of this, a great part
of natural philosophy consists.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Magnitude, what it is.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.4'></a>4. The <em>extension</em> of a body, is the same thing
with the <em>magnitude</em> of it, or that which some call
<em>real space</em>. But this <em>magnitude</em> does not depend
upon our cogitation, as imaginary space doth; for
this is an effect of our imagination, but <em>magnitude</em>
is the cause of it; this is an accident of the mind,
that of a body existing out of the mind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Place, what it is, and that it is immovable.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.5'></a>5. That space, by which word I here understand
imaginary space, which is coincident with the
magnitude of any body, is called the <em>place</em> of that
body; and the body itself is that which we call
the <em>thing placed</em>. Now <em>place</em>, and the <em>magnitude</em>
of the thing placed, differ. First in this, that a
body keeps always the same <em>magnitude</em>, both
when it is at rest, and when it is moved; but when
it is moved, it does not keep the same <em>place</em>.
Secondly in this, that <em>place</em> is a phantasm of any
body of such and such quantity and figure; but
<em>magnitude</em> is the peculiar accident of every body;
for one body may at several times have several
places, but has always one and the same magnitude.
Thirdly in this, that <em>place</em> is nothing out of the
mind, nor <em>magnitude</em> any thing within it. And
lastly, <em>place</em> is feigned extension, but <em>magnitude</em>
true extension; and a placed body is not extension,
but a thing extended. Besides, <em>place is immovable</em>;
for, seeing that which is moved, is understood to
be carried from place to place, if place were
moved, it would also be carried from place to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>place, so that one place must have another place,
and that place another place, and so on infinitely,
which is ridiculous. And as for those, that, by
making <em>place</em> to be of the same nature with <em>real
space</em>, would from thence maintain it to be
immovable, they also make place, though they do
not perceive they make it so, to be a mere phantasm.
For whilst one affirms that place is therefore
said to be immovable, because space in general is
considered there; if he had remembered that
nothing is general or universal besides names or
signs, he would easily have seen that that space,
which he says is considered in general, is nothing
but a phantasm, in the mind or the memory, of a
body of such magnitude and such figure. And
whilst another says: real space is made immovable
by the understanding; as when, under the superficies
of running water, we imagine other and
other water to come by continual succession, that
superficies fixed there by the understanding, is the
<em>immovable place</em> of the river: what else does he
make it to be but a phantasm, though he do it
obscurely and in perplexed words? Lastly, the
nature of <em>place</em> does not consist in the <em>superficies
of the ambient</em>, but in <em>solid space</em>; for the whole
placed body is coextended with its whole place,
and every part of it with every answering part of
the same place; but seeing every placed body is a
solid thing, it cannot be understood to be coextended
with superficies. Besides, how can any
whole body be moved, unless all its parts be
moved together with it? Or how can the internal
parts of it be moved, but by leaving their place?
But the internal parts of a body cannot leave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>superficies of an external part contiguous to it;
and, therefore, it follows, that if place be the
superficies of the ambient, then the parts of a
body moved, that is, bodies moved, are not moved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is full and empty.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.6'></a>6. Space, or place, that is possessed by a body,
is called <em>full</em>, and that which is not so possessed,
is called <em>empty</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Here, there, somewhere, what they signify.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.7'></a>7. <em>Here</em>, <em>there</em>, <em>in the country</em>, <em>in the city</em>, and
other the like names, by which answer is made to
the question <em>where is it?</em> are not properly names
of place, nor do they of themselves bring into the
mind the place that is sought; for <em>here</em> and <em>there</em>
signify nothing, unless the thing be shewn at the
same time with the finger or something else; but
when the eye of him that seeks, is, by pointing or
some other sign, directed to the thing sought, the
place of it is not hereby defined by him that
answers, but found out by him that asks the question.
Now such shewings as are made by words
only, as when we say, <em>in the country</em>, or <em>in the
city</em>, are some of greater latitude than others, as
when we say, <em>in the country</em>, <em>in the city</em>, <em>in such a
street</em>, <em>in a house</em>, <em>in the chamber</em>, <em>in bed</em>, &#38;c.
For these do, by little and little, direct the seeker
nearer to the proper place; and yet they do not
determine the same, but only restrain it to a lesser
space, and signify no more, than that the place of
the thing is within a certain space designed by
those words, as a part is in the whole. And all
such names, by which answer is made to the question
<em>where?</em> have, for their highest <em>genus</em>, the
name <em>somewhere</em>. From whence it may be understood,
that whatsoever is somewhere, is in some
place properly so called, which place is part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>that greater space that is signified by some of these
names, <em>in the country</em>, <em>in the city</em>, or the like.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Many bodies cannot be in one place, nor one body in many places.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.8'></a>8. A body, and the magnitude, and the place
thereof, are divided by one and the same act of
the mind; for, to divide an extended body, and the
extension thereof, and the idea of that extension,
which is place, is the same with dividing any one
of them; because they are coincident, and it
cannot be done but by the mind, that is by the
division of space. From whence it is manifest,
that neither two bodies can be together in the
same place, nor one body be in two places at the
same time. Not two bodies in the same place;
because when a body that fills its whole place is
divided into two, the place itself is divided into
two also, so that there will be two places. Not
one body in two places; for the place that a body
fills being divided into two, the placed body will
be also divided into two; for, as I said, a place
and the body that fills that place, are divided both
together; and so there will be two bodies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Contiguous and continual, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.9'></a>9. Two bodies are said to be <em>contiguous</em> to one
another, and <em>continual</em>, in the same manner as
spaces are; namely, <em>those are contiguous, between
which there is no space</em>. Now, by space I understand,
here as formerly, an idea or phantasm of a
body. Wherefore, though between two bodies
there be put no other body, and consequently no
magnitude, or, as they call it, real space, yet if
another body may be put between them, that is, if
there intercede any imagined space which may
receive another body, then those bodies are not
contiguous. And this is so easy to be understood,
that I should wonder at some men, who being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>otherwise skilful enough in philosophy, are of a
different opinion, but that I find that most of those
that affect metaphysical subtleties wander from
truth, as if they were led out of their way by an
<em>ignis fatuus</em>. For can any man that has his
natural senses, think that two bodies must
therefore necessarily touch one another, because
no other body is between them? Or that there
can be no <em>vacuum</em>, because <em>vacuum</em> is nothing, or
as they call it, <em>non ens</em>? Which is as childish, as
if one should reason thus; no man can fast,
because to fast is to eat nothing; but nothing
cannot be eaten. <em>Continual, are any two bodies
that have a common part; and more than two are
continual, when every two, that are next to one
another, are continual.</em></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The definition of motion. No motion intelligible but with time.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.10'></a>10. <span class='fss'>MOTION</span> <em>is a continual relinquishing of
one place, and acquiring of another</em>; and that
place which is relinquished is commonly called the
<span lang="la"><i>terminus a quo</i></span>, as that which is acquired is called
the <span lang="la"><i>terminus ad quem</i></span>; I say a continual relinquishing,
because no body, how little soever, can
totally and at once go out of its former place into
another, so, but that some part of it will be in a
part of a place which is common to both, namely,
to the relinquished and the acquired places. <span class='sni illus'><span class='hidev'>|</span> A  G  B  I  E<br> +-----+------+<br> <br>  :  <br>  :   <br><br> <br>  :  <br>  :   <br><br> +-----+------+<br> C  H  D  K  F<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For
example, let any body be in the
place A C B D; the same body cannot
come into the place B D E F,
but it must first be in G H I K,
whose part G H B D is common to
both the places A C B D, and G H I K, and
whose part B D I K, is common to both the places
G H I K, and B D E F. Now it cannot be conceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>that any thing can be moved without time;
for time is, by the definition of it, a phantasm, that
is, a conception of motion; and, therefore, to conceive
that any thing may be moved without time,
were to conceive motion without motion, which is
impossible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What it is to be at rest, to have been moved, and to be moved. No motion to be conceived without the conception of past and future.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.11'></a>11. <i>That is said to be at rest, which, during
any time, is in one place; and that to be moved,
or to have been moved, which, whether it be now
at rest or moved, was formerly in another place
than that which it is now in.</i> From which definitions
it may be inferred, first, that <em>whatsoever is
moved, has been moved</em>; for if it be still in the
same place in which it was formerly, it is at rest,
that is, it is not moved, by the definition of <em>rest</em>;
but if it be in another place, it has been moved,
by the definition of <em>moved</em>. Secondly, that <em>what
is moved, will yet be moved</em>; for that which is
moved, leaveth the place where it is, and therefore
will be in another place, and consequently will
be moved still. Thirdly, that <em>whatsoever is
moved, is not in one place during any time, how
little soever that time be</em>; for by the definition of
rest, that which is in one place during any time,
is at rest.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a certain sophism against motion, which
seems to spring from the not understanding of
this last proposition. For they say, that, <em>if any
body be moved, it is moved either in the place
where it is, or in the place where it is not; both
which are false; and therefore nothing is moved</em>.
But the falsity lies in the major proposition; for
that which is moved, is neither moved in the place
where it is, nor in the place where is not; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>from the place where it is, to the place where it is
not. Indeed it cannot be denied but that whatsoever
is moved, is moved somewhere, that is,
within some space; but then the place of that
body is not that whole space, but a part of it, as
is said above in the seventh article. From what
is above demonstrated, namely, that whatsoever is
moved, has also been moved, and will be moved,
this also may be collected, that there can be no
conception of motion, without conceiving past
and future time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A point, a line, superficies, and solid, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.12'></a>12. Though there be no body which has not
some magnitude, yet if, when any body is moved,
the magnitude of it be not at all considered, the
way it makes is called a <em>line</em>, or one single
dimension; and the space, through which it
passeth, is called <em>length</em>; and the body itself, a
<em>point</em>; in which sense the earth is called a <em>point</em>,
and the way of its yearly revolution, the <em>ecliptic
line</em>. But if a body, which is moved, be considered
as <em>long</em>, and be supposed to be so moved, as that
all the several parts of it be understood to make
several lines, then the way of every part of that
body is called <em>breadth</em>, and the space which is
made is called <em>superficies</em>, consisting of two
dimensions, one whereof to every several part of
the other is applied whole. Again, if a body be
considered as having <em>superficies</em>, and be understood
to be so moved, that all the several parts of
it describe several lines, then the way of every
part of that body is called <em>thickness</em> or <em>depth</em>,
and the space which is made is called <em>solid</em>,
consisting of three dimensions, any two whereof
are applied whole to every several part of the
third.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>But if a body be considered as <em>solid</em>, then it is
not possible that all the several parts of it should
describe several lines; for what way soever it be
moved, the way of the following part will fall into
the way of the part before it, so that the same
solid will still be made which the foremost superficies
would have made by itself. And therefore
there can be no other dimension in any body, as
it is a body, than the three which I have now
described; though, as it shall be shewed hereafter,
<em>velocity</em>, which is motion according to <em>length</em>,
may, by being applied to all the parts of a <em>solid</em>,
make a magnitude of motion, consisting of four
dimensions; as the goodness of gold, computed
in all the parts of it, makes the price and value
thereof.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Equal, great, greater, and less, in bodies and magnitudes, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.13'></a>13. <em>Bodies</em>, how many soever they be, that
can fill every one the place of every one, are said
to be <em>equal</em> every one to every other. Now, one
body may fill the same place which another body
filleth, though it be not of the same figure with
that other body, if so be that it may be understood
to be reducible to the same figure, either by
flexion or transposition of the parts. And <em>one
body is greater than another body, when a part
of that is equal to all this; and less, when all
that is equal to a part of this</em>. Also, <em>magnitudes</em>
are <em>equal</em>, or <em>greater</em>, or <em>lesser</em>, than one another,
for the same consideration, namely, when the
bodies, of which they are the magnitudes, are
either <em>equal</em>, or <em>greater</em>, or <em>less</em>, &#38;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>One and the same body has always one and the same magnitude.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.14'></a>14. One and the same body is always of one
and the same magnitude. For seeing a body
and the magnitude and place thereof cannot be
comprehended in the mind otherwise than as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>are coincident, if any body be understood to be at
rest, that is, to remain in the same place during
some time, and the magnitude thereof be in one
part of that time greater, and in another part less,
that body's place, which is one and the same, will
be coincident sometimes with greater, sometimes
with less magnitude, that is, the same place will be
greater and less than itself, which is impossible.
But there would be no need at all of demonstrating
a thing that is in itself so manifest, if there were
not some, whose opinion concerning bodies and
their magnitudes is, that a body may exist separated
from its magnitude, and have greater or less magnitude
bestowed upon it, making use of this
principle for the explication of the nature of <span lang="la"><i>rarum</i></span>
and <span lang="la"><i>densum</i></span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Velocity, what it is.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.15'></a>15. Motion, in as much as a certain length may
in a certain time be transmitted by it, is called
<span class='fss'>VELOCITY</span> or <em>swiftness</em>: &#38;c. For though <em>swift</em>
be very often understood with relation to <em>slower</em>
or <em>less swift</em>, as great is in respect of less, yet
nevertheless, as magnitude is by philosophers taken
absolutely for extension, so also <em>velocity</em> or <em>swiftness</em>
may be put absolutely for motion according to
length.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Equal, greater, and less, in times, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.16'></a>16. Many motions are said to be made in equal
times, when every one of them begins and ends
together with some other motion, or if it had
begun together, would also have ended together
with the same. For time, which is a phantasm of
motion, cannot be reckoned but by some exposed
motion; as in dials by the motion of the sun or of
the hand; and if two or more motions begin and
end with this motion, they are said to be made in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>equal times; from whence also it is easy to understand
what it is to be moved in greater or longer
time, and in less time or not so long; namely,
that that is longer moved, which beginning with
another, ends later; or ending together, began
sooner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Equal, greater, and less, in velocity, what.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.17'></a>17. Motions are said to be equally swift, when
equal lengths are transmitted in equal times; and
greater swiftness is that, wherein greater length is
passed in equal time, or equal length in less time.
Also that swiftness by which equal lengths are
passed in equal parts of time, is called <em>uniform</em>
swiftness or motion; and of motions <em>not uniform</em>,
such as become swifter or slower by equal increasings
or decreasings in equal parts of time, are
said to be <em>accelerated</em> or <em>retarded uniformly</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Equal, greater, and less, in motion, what.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.18'></a>18. But motion is said to be greater, less, and
equal, not only in regard of the length which is
transmitted in a certain time, that is, in regard of
swiftness only, but of swiftness applied to every
smallest particle of magnitude; for when any
body is moved, every part of it is also moved; and
supposing the parts to be halves, the motions of
those halves have their swiftness equal to one
another, and severally equal to that of the whole;
but the motion of the whole is equal to those two
motions, either of which is of equal swiftness with
it; and therefore it is one thing for two motions
to be equal to one another, and another thing for
them to be equally swift. And this is manifest in
two horses that draw abreast, where the motion of
both the horses together is of equal swiftness with
the motion of either of them singly; but the
motion of both is greater than the motion of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>of them, namely, double. Wherefore <i>motions are
said to be simply equal to one another, when the
swiftness of one, computed in every part of its
magnitude, is equal to the swiftness of the other
computed also in every part of its magnitude:
and greater than one another, when the swiftness
of one computed as above, is greater than the
swiftness of the other so computed; and less,
when less</i>. Besides, the magnitude of motion
computed in this manner is that which is commonly
called <span class='fss'>FORCE</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>That which is at rest will always be at rest, except it be moved by some external thing.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.19'></a>19. <i>Whatsoever is at rest, will always be at
rest, unless there be some other body besides it,
which, by endeavouring to get into its place by
motion, suffers it no longer to remain at rest.</i>
For suppose that some finite body exist and be at
rest, and that all space besides be empty; if now
this body begin to be moved, it will certainly be
moved some way; seeing therefore there was
nothing in that body which did not dispose it to
rest, the reason why it is moved this way is in
something out of it; and in like manner, if it had
been moved any other way, the reason of motion
that way had also been in something out of it; but
seeing it was supposed that nothing is out of it,
the reason of its motion one way would be the
same with the reason of its motion every other
way, wherefore it would be moved alike all ways
at once; which is impossible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>That which is moved will always be moved, unless it be hindered by some external thing.</div>

<p class='c001'>In like manner, <i>whatsoever is moved, will
always be moved, except there be some other body
besides it, which causeth it to rest</i>. For if we
suppose nothing to be without it, there will be no
reason why it should rest now, rather than at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>another time; wherefore its motion would cease
in every particle of time alike; which is not
intelligible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Accidents are generated and destroyed, but bodies not so.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.20'></a>20. When we say a living creature, a tree, or any
other specified body is <em>generated</em> or <em>destroyed</em>,
it is not to be so understood as if there were made
a body of that which is not-body, or not a body of
a body, but of a living creature not a living creature,
of a tree not a tree, &#38;c. that is, that those
accidents for which we call one thing a living
creature, another thing a tree, and another by
some other name, are generated and destroyed;
and that therefore the same names are not to be
given to them now, which were given them before.
But that magnitude for which we give to any
thing the name of body is neither generated nor
destroyed. For though we may feign in our mind
that a point may swell to a huge bulk, and that
this may again contract itself to a point; that is,
though we may imagine something to arise where
before was nothing, and nothing to be there where
before was something, yet we cannot comprehend
in our mind how this may possibly be done in
nature. And therefore philosophers, who tie
themselves to natural reason, suppose that a body
can neither be generated nor destroyed, but only
that it may appear otherwise than it did to us,
that is, under different <em>species</em>, and consequently
be called by other and other names; so that that
which is now called man, may at another time
have the name of not-man; but that which is once
called body, can never be called not-body. But it
is manifest, that all other accidents besides magnitude
or extension may be generated and destroyed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>as when a white thing is made black, the whiteness
that was in it perisheth, and the blackness that
was not in it is now generated; and therefore
bodies, and the accidents under which they appear
diversely, have this difference, that bodies are
things, and not generated; accidents are generated,
and not things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An accident cannot depart from its subject</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.21'></a>21. And therefore, when any thing appears
otherwise than it did by reason of other and other
accidents, it is not to be thought that an accident
goes out of one subject into another, (for they are
not, as I said above, in their subjects as a part in
the whole, or as a contained thing in that which
contains it, or as a master of a family in his house,)
but that one accident perisheth, and another is
generated. For example, when the hand, being
moved, moves the pen, motion does not go out of
the hand into the pen; for so the writing might be
continued though the hand stood still; but a new
motion is generated in the pen, and is the pen's
motion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nor be moved.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.22'></a>22. And therefore also it is improper to say, an
accident is moved; as when, instead of saying,
<em>figure is an accident of a body carried away</em>, we
say, <em>a body carries away its figure</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Essence, form, and matter, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.23'></a>23. Now that accident for which we give a
certain name to any body, or the accident which
denominates its subject, is commonly called the
<span class='fss'>ESSENCE</span> thereof; as rationality is the essence of
a man; whiteness, of any white thing, and extension
the essence of a body. And the same essence,
in as much as it is generated, is called the <span class='fss'>FORM</span>.
Again, a body, in respect of any accident, is called
the <span class='fss'>SUBJECT</span>, and in respect of the form it is
called the <span class='fss'>MATTER</span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Also, the production or perishing of any accident
makes its subject be said <em>to be changed</em>; only the
production or perishing of form makes it be said it
is <em>generated</em> or <em>destroyed</em>; but in all generation
and mutation, the name of <em>matter</em> still remains.
For a table made of wood is not only wooden, but
wood; and a statue of brass is brass as well as
brazen; though Aristotle, in his <cite>Metaphysics</cite>, says,
that whatsoever is made of any thing ought not to
be called ἐκεινὸ, but ἐκέινινον; as that which is made
of wood, not ξύλον, but ξύλινον, that is, not wood,
but wooden.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First matter, what.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.24'></a>24. And as for that matter which is common to
all things, and which philosophers, following Aristotle,
usually call <span lang="la"><i>materia prima</i></span>, that is, <em>first
matter</em>, it is not any body distinct from all other
bodies, nor is it one of them. What then is it?
A mere name; yet a name which is not of vain
use; for it signifies a conception of body without
the consideration of any form or other accident
except only magnitude or extension, and aptness
to receive form and other accident. So that whensoever
we have use of the name <em>body in general</em>,
if we use that of <em>materia prima</em>, we do well. For
as when a man not knowing which was first,
water or ice, would find out which of the two were
the matter of both, he would be fain to suppose
some third matter which were neither of these
two; so he that would find out what is the matter
of all things, ought to suppose such as is not the
matter of anything that exists. Wherefore <span lang="la"><i>materia
prima</i></span> is nothing; and therefore they do not
attribute to it either form or any other accident
besides quantity; whereas all singular things have
their forms and accidents certain.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span><span lang="la"><i>Materia prima</i></span>, therefore, is body in general,
that is, body considered universally, not as having
neither form nor any accident, but in which no
form nor any other accident but quantity are at all
considered, that is, they are not drawn into argumentation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>That the whole is greater than any part thereof, why demonstrated.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art8.25'></a>25. From what has been said, those axioms may
be demonstrated, which are assumed by Euclid in
the beginning of his first element, about the equality
and inequality of magnitudes; of which,
omitting the rest, I will here demonstrate only
this one, <i>the whole is greater than any part
thereof</i>; to the end that the reader may know that
those axioms are not indemonstrable, and therefore
not principles of demonstration; and from hence
learn to be wary how he admits any thing for a
principle, which is not at least as evident as these
are. <em>Greater</em> is defined to be that, whose part is
equal to the whole of another. Now if we suppose
any whole to be A, and a part of it to be B;
seeing the whole B is equal to itself, and the same
B is a part of A; therefore a part of A will be
equal to the whole B. Wherefore, by the definition
above, A is greater than B; which was to be proved.</p>

Contingent accidents, what they are.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Action and passion, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art9.1'></a>1. A body is said to work upon or <em>act</em>, that is to
say, <em>do</em> something to another body, when it either
generates or destroys some accident in it: and the
body in which an accident is generated or destroyed
is said to <em>suffer</em>, that is, to have something <em>done</em> to
it by another body; as when one body by putting
forwards another body generates motion in it, it is
called the <span class='fss'>AGENT</span>; and the body in which motion
is so generated, is called the <span class='fss'>PATIENT</span>; so fire that
warms the hand is the <em>agent</em>, and the hand, which
is warmed, is the <em>patient</em>. That accident, which
is generated in the patient, is called the <span class='fss'>EFFECT</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Action and passion, mediate, and immediate.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art9.2'></a>2. When an agent and patient are contiguous to
one another, their action and passion are then said
to be <em>immediate</em>, otherwise, <em>mediate</em>; and when
another body, lying betwixt the agent and patient,
is contiguous to them both, it is then itself both an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>agent and a patient; an agent in respect of the
body next after it, upon which it works, and a
patient in respect of the body next before it, from
which it suffers. Also, if many bodies be so
ordered that every two which are next to one
another be contiguous, then all those that are
betwixt the first and the last are both agents and
patients, and the first is an agent only, and the last
a patient only.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cause simply taken.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art9.3'></a>3. An agent is understood to <em>produce</em> its determined
or certain effect in the patient, according to
some certain accident or accidents, with which
both it and the patient are affected; that is to say,
the agent hath its effect precisely such, not because
it is a body, but because such a body, or so moved.
For otherwise all agents, seeing they are all bodies
alike, would produce like effects in all patients.
And therefore the fire, for example, does not warm,
because it is a body, but because it is hot; nor
does one body put forward another body because it
is a body, but because it is moved into the place
of that other body. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cause without which no effect follows, or cause necessary by supposition.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The cause, therefore, of all
effects consists in certain accidents both in the
agents and in the patients; which when they are
all present, the effect is produced; but if any one
of them be wanting, it is not produced; and that
accident either of the agent or patient, without
which the effect cannot be produced, is called
<span lang="la"><i>causa sine qua non</i></span>, or <span lang="la"><i>cause necessary by supposition</i></span>,
as also the <cite>cause requisite for the production
of the effect</cite>. But a <span class='fss'>CAUSE</span> simply, or <i>an
entire cause, is the aggregate of all the accidents
both of the agents how many soever they be, and
of the patient, put together; which when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>are all supposed to be present, it cannot be understood
but that the effect is produced at the same
instant; and if any one of them be wanting, it
cannot be understood but that the effect is not
produced</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cause efficient, and material.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art9.4'></a>4. The aggregate of accidents in the agent or
agents, requisite for the production of the effect,
the effect being produced, is called the <em>efficient
cause</em> thereof; and the aggregate of accidents in
the patient, the effect being produced, is usually
called the <em>material cause</em>; I say the effect being
produced; for where there is no effect, there can
be no cause; for nothing can be called a cause,
where there is nothing that can be called an
effect. But the efficient and material causes are
both but partial causes, or parts of that cause, which
in the next precedent article I called an entire
cause. And from hence it is manifest, that the
effect we expect, though the agents be not defective
on their part, may nevertheless be frustrated by a
defect in the patient; and when the patient is
sufficient, by a defect in the agents.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An entire cause is always sufficient to produce its effect.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art9.5'></a>5. An entire cause is always sufficient for the
production of its effect, if the effect be at all
possible. For let any effect whatsoever be propounded
to be produced; if the same be produced,
it is manifest that the cause which produced it was
a sufficient cause; but if it be not produced, and
yet be possible, it is evident that something was
wanting either in some agent, or in the patient,
without which it could not be produced; that is,
that some accident was wanting which was requisite
for its production; and therefore, that cause was
not <em>entire</em>, which is contrary to what was supposed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>At the same instant that the cause is entire, the effect is produced.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>It follows also from hence, that in whatsoever
instant the cause is entire, in the same instant the
effect is produced. For if it be not produced,
something is still wanting, which is requisite for
the production of it; and therefore the cause was
not entire, as was supposed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Every effect has a necessary cause.</div>

<p class='c001'>And seeing a necessary cause is defined to be
that, which being supposed, the effect cannot but
follow; this also may be collected, that whatsoever
effect is produced at any time, the same is produced
by a necessary cause. For whatsoever is produced,
in as much as it is produced, had an entire cause,
that is, had all those things, which being supposed,
it cannot be understood but that the effect follows;
that is, it had a necessary cause. And in the
same manner it may be shewn, that whatsoever
effects are hereafter to be produced, shall have a
necessary cause; so that all the effects that have
been, or shall be produced, have their necessity in
things antecedent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The generation of effects is continual. What is the beginning in causation.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art9.6'></a>6. And from this, that whensoever the cause is
entire, the effect is produced in the same instant,
it is manifest that causation and the production
of effects consist in a certain continual progress;
so that as there is a continual mutation in the
agent or agents, by the working of other agents
upon them, so also the patient, upon which they
work, is continually altered and changed. For
example: as the heat of the fire increases more
and more, so also the effects thereof, namely, the
heat of such bodies as are next to it, and again, of
such other bodies as are next to them, increase
more and more accordingly; which is already no
little argument that all mutation consists in motion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>only; the truth whereof shall be further demonstrated
in the ninth article. But in this progress
of causation, that is, of action and passion, if any
man comprehend in his imagination a part thereof,
and divide the same into parts, the first part or
beginning of it cannot be considered otherwise
than as action or cause; for, if it should be considered
as effect or passion, then it would be necessary
to consider something before it, for its cause
or action; which cannot be, for nothing can be
before the beginning. And in like manner, the
last part is considered only as effect; for it cannot
be called cause, if nothing follow it; but after the
last, nothing follows. And from hence it is, that in
all action the beginning and cause are taken for
the same thing. But every one of the intermediate
parts are both action and passion, and cause and
effect, according as they are compared with the
antecedent or subsequent part.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>No cause of motion but in a body contiguous and moved.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art9.7'></a>7. There can be no cause of motion, except in a
body contiguous and moved. For let there be
any two bodies which are not contiguous, and betwixt
which the intermediate space is empty, or, if
filled, filled with another body which is at rest;
and let one of the propounded bodies be supposed
to be at rest; I say it shall always be at rest. For
if it shall be moved, the cause of that motion, by
the 8th chapter, article 19, will be some external
body; and, therefore, if between it and that external
body there be nothing but empty space,
then whatsoever the disposition be of that external
body or of the patient itself, yet if it be supposed
to be now at rest, we may conceive it will continue
so till it be touched by some other body.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>But seeing cause, by the definition, is the aggregate
of all such accidents, which being supposed
to be present, it cannot be conceived but that the
effect will follow, those accidents, which are either
in external bodies, or in the patient itself, cannot
be the cause of future motion. And in like manner,
seeing we may conceive that whatsoever is at rest
will still be at rest, though it be touched by some
other body, except that other body be moved;
therefore in a contiguous body, which is at rest,
there can be no cause of motion. Wherefore there
is no cause of motion in any body, except it be
contiguous and moved.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same reason may serve to prove that whatsoever
is moved, will always be moved on in the
same way and with the same velocity, except it
be hindered by some other contiguous and moved
body; and consequently that no bodies, either
when they are at rest, or when there is an interposition
of vacuum, can generate or extinguish or
lessen motion in other bodies. There is one that
has written that things moved are more resisted
by things at rest, than by things contrarily moved;
for this reason, that he conceived motion not to be
so contrary to motion as rest. That which deceived
him was, that the words <em>rest</em> and <em>motion</em> are but
contradictory names; whereas motion, indeed, is
not resisted by rest, but by contrary motion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The same agents and patients, if alike disposed, produce like effects, though at different times.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art9.8'></a>8. But if a body work upon another body at one
time, and afterwards the same body work upon the
same body at another time, so that both the agent
and patient, and all their parts, be in all things as
they were; and there be no difference, except only
in time, that is, that one action be former, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>other later in time; it is manifest of itself, that the
effects will be equal and like, as not differing in
anything besides time. And as effects themselves
proceed from their causes, so the diversity of them
depends upon the diversity of their causes also.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>All mutation is motion.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art9.9'></a>9. This being true, it is necessary that mutation
can be nothing else but motion of the parts of that
body which is changed. For first, we do not say
anything is changed, but that which appears to our
senses otherwise than it appeared formerly. Secondly,
both those appearances are effects produced
in the sentient; and, therefore, if they be
different, it is necessary, by the preceding article,
that either some part of the agent, which was formerly
at rest, is now moved, and so the mutation
consists in this motion; or some part, which was
formerly moved, is now otherwise moved, and so
also the mutation consists in this new motion; or
which, being formerly moved, is now at rest,
which, as I have shewn above, cannot come to
pass without motion; and so again, mutation is
motion; or lastly, it happens in some of these
manners to the patient, or some of its parts; so
that mutation, howsoever it be made, will consist
in the motion of the parts, either of the body
which is perceived, or of the sentient body, or of
both. Mutation therefore is motion, namely, of
the parts either of the agent or of the patient;
which was to be demonstrated. And to this it is
consequent, that rest cannot be the cause of anything,
nor can any action proceed from it; seeing
neither motion nor mutation can be caused by it.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Power and cause are the same thing.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art10.1'></a>1. Correspondent to <em>cause</em> and <em>effect</em>, are
<span class='fss'>POWER</span> and <span class='fss'>ACT</span>; nay, those and these are the
same things; though, for divers considerations,
they have divers names. For whensoever any
agent has all those accidents which are necessarily
requisite for the production of some effect in the
patient, then we say that agent has <em>power</em> to produce
that effect, if it be applied to a patient. But,
as I have shewn in the precedent chapter, those
accidents constitute the efficient cause; and therefore
the same accidents, which constitute the
efficient cause, constitute also the <em>power</em> of the
agent. Wherefore the <em>power of the agent</em> and
the <em>efficient cause</em> are the same thing. But they
are considered with this difference, that <em>cause</em> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>so called in respect of the effect already produced,
and power in respect of the same effect to be produced
hereafter; so that <em>cause</em> respects the past,
<em>power</em> the future time. Also, the <em>power of the
agent</em> is that which is commonly called <em>active
power</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In like manner, whensoever any patient has all
those accidents which it is requisite it should have,
for the production of some effect in it, we say it is
in the <em>power</em> of that patient to produce that effect,
if it be applied to a fitting agent. But those accidents,
as is defined in the precedent chapter, constitute
the material cause; and therefore the <em>power
of the patient</em>, commonly called <em>passive power</em>,
and <em>material cause</em>, are the same thing; but with
this different consideration, that in cause the past
time, and in power the future, is respected.
Wherefore the power of the agent and patient
together, which may be called entire or <em>plenary
power</em>, is the same thing with <em>entire cause</em>; for
they both consist in the sum or aggregate of all
the accidents, as well in the agent as in the patient,
which are requisite for the production of the effect.
Lastly, as the accident produced is, in respect of
the cause, called an effect, so in respect of the
power, it is called an <em>act</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An act is produced at the same instant in which the power is plenary.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art10.2'></a>2. As therefore the effect is produced in the
same instant in which the cause is entire, so also
every act that may be produced, is produced in the
same instant in which the power is plenary. And
as there can be no effect but from a sufficient and
necessary cause, so also no act can be produced but
by sufficient power, or that power by which it
could not but be produced.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Active and passive power are parts only of plenary power.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span><a id='art10.3'></a>3. And as it is manifest, as I have shewn, that
the efficient and material causes are severally and
by themselves parts only of an entire cause, and
cannot produce any effect but by being joined
together, so also power, active and passive, are
parts only of plenary and entire power; nor, except
they be joined, can any act proceed from them;
and therefore these powers, as I said in the first
article, are but conditional, namely, <em>the agent has
power, if it be applied to a patient; and the
patient has power, if it be applied to an agent</em>;
otherwise neither of them have power, nor can the
accidents, which are in them severally, be properly
called powers; nor any action be said to be possible
for the power of the agent alone or of the
patient alone.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An act, when said to be possible.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art10.4'></a>4. For that is an impossible act, for the production
of which there is no power plenary. For
seeing plenary power is that in which all things
concur, which are requisite for the production of
an act, if the power shall never be plenary, there
will always be wanting some of those things, without
which the act cannot be produced; wherefore
that act shall never be produced; that is, that act
is <span class='fss'>IMPOSSIBLE</span>: and every act, which is not impossible,
is <span class='fss'>POSSIBLE</span>. Every act, therefore, which is
possible, shall at some time be produced; for if it
shall never be produced, then those things shall
never concur which are requisite for the production
of it; wherefore that act is <em>impossible</em>, by the
definition; which is contrary to what was supposed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An act necessary and contingent, what.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art10.5'></a>5. A <em>necessary act</em> is that, the production
whereof it is impossible to hinder; and therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>every act, that shall be produced, shall necessarily
be produced; for, that it shall not be produced, is
impossible; because, as is already demonstrated,
every possible act shall at some time be produced;
nay, this proposition, <em>what shall be, shall be</em>, is as
necessary a proposition as this, <em>a man is a man</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But here, perhaps, some man may ask whether
those future things, which are commonly called
<em>contingents</em>, are necessary. I say, therefore, that
generally all contingents have their necessary
causes, as is shewn in the preceding chapter; but
are called contingents in respect of other events,
upon which they do not depend; as the rain, which
shall be tomorrow, shall be necessary, that is,
from necessary causes; but we think and say it
happens by chance, because we do not yet perceive
the causes thereof, though they exist now; for men
commonly call that <em>casual</em> or <em>contingent</em>, whereof
they do not perceive the necessary cause; and in
the same manner they used to speak of things past,
when not knowing whether a thing be done or no,
they say it is possible it never was done.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wherefore, all propositions concerning future
things, contingent or not contingent, as this, <em>it
will rain tomorrow</em>, or this, <em>tomorrow the sun
will rise</em>, are either necessarily true, or necessarily
false; but we call them contingent, because we do
not yet know whether they be true or false;
whereas their verity depends not upon our knowledge,
but upon the foregoing of their causes. But
there are some, who though they confess this whole
proposition, <em>tomorrow it will either rain, or not
rain</em>, to be true, yet they will not acknowledge the
parts of it, as, <em>tomorrow it will rain</em>, or, <em>tomorrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>it will not rain</em>, to be either of them true by itself;
because they say neither this nor that is true <em>determinately</em>.
But what is this <em>determinately true</em>, but
true upon our knowledge, or evidently true? And
therefore they say no more but that it is not yet
known whether it be true or no; but they say it
more obscurely, and darken the evidence of the
truth with the same words, with which they endeavour
to hide their own ignorance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Active power consists in motion.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art10.6'></a>6. In the 9th article of the preceding chapter, I
have shewn that the efficient cause of all motion
and mutation consists in the motion of the agent,
or agents; and in the first article of this chapter,
that the power of the agent is the same thing with
the efficient cause. From whence it may be understood,
that all active power consists in motion also;
and that power is not a certain accident, which
differs from all acts, but is, indeed, an act, namely,
motion, which is therefore called power, because
another act shall be produced by it afterwards.
For example, if of three bodies the first put
forward the second, and this the third, the motion
of the second, in respect of the first which produceth
it, is the act of the second body; but, in
respect of the third, it is the active power of the
same second body.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cause, formal and final, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art10.7'></a>7. The writers of metaphysics reckon up two
other causes besides the <em>efficient</em> and <em>material</em>,
namely, the <span class='fss'>ESSENCE</span>, which some call the <em>formal
cause</em>, and the <span class='fss'>END</span>, or <em>final cause</em>; both which
are nevertheless efficient causes. For when it is
said the essence of a thing is the cause thereof, <em>as
to be rational is the cause of man</em>, it is not intelligible;
for it is all one, as if it were said, <em>to be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>man is the cause of man</em>; which is not well said.
And yet the knowledge of the <em>essence</em> of anything,
is the cause of the knowledge of the thing itself;
for, if I first know that a thing is <em>rational</em>, I know
from thence, that the same is <em>man</em>; but this is no
other than an efficient cause. A <em>final cause</em> has no
place but in such things as have sense and will;
and this also I shall prove hereafter to be an efficient
cause.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>What it is for one thing to differ from another.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art11.1'></a>1. Hitherto I have spoken of body simply, and
accidents common to all bodies, as <em>magnitude</em>,
<em>motion</em>, <em>rest</em>, <em>action</em>, <em>passion</em>, <em>power</em>, <em>possible</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i>;
and I should now descend to those accidents by
which one body is distinguished from another, but
that it is first to be declared what it is to be <em>distinct</em>
and <em>not distinct</em>, namely, what are the <span class='fss'>SAME</span>
and <span class='fss'>DIFFERENT</span>; for this also is common to all
bodies, that they may be distinguished and differenced
from one another. Now, two bodies are
said to <em>differ</em> from one another, when something
may be said of one of them, which cannot be said
of the other at the same time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>To differ in number, magnitude, species, and genus, what.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span><a id='art11.2'></a>2. And, first of all, it is manifest that no two
bodies are the <em>same</em>; for seeing they are two, they
are in two places at the same time; as that, which is
the <em>same</em>, is at the same time in one and the same
place. All bodies therefore differ from one another
in <em>number</em>, namely, as one and another; so that
the <em>same</em> and <em>different in number</em>, are names
opposed to one another by contradiction.</p>

<p class='c001'>In <em>magnitude</em> bodies differ when one is greater
than another, as <em>a cubit long</em>, and <em>two cubits long</em>,
of <em>two pound weight</em>, and of <em>three pound weight</em>.
And to these, <em>equals</em> are opposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bodies, which differ more than in magnitude, are
called <em>unlike</em>; and those, which differ only in magnitude,
<em>like</em>. Also, of unlike bodies, some are said
to differ in the <em>species</em>, others in the <em>genus</em>; in the
<em>species</em>, when their difference is perceived by one
and the same sense, as <em>white</em> and <em>black</em>; and in the
<em>genus</em>, when their difference is not perceived but
by divers senses, as <em>white</em> and <em>hot</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is relation, proportion, and relatives.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art11.3'></a>3. And the <em>likeness</em>, or <em>unlikeness</em>, <em>equality</em>, or
<em>inequality</em> of one body to another, is called their
<span class='fss'>RELATION</span>; and the bodies themselves <em>relatives</em> or
<em>correlatives</em>; <em>Aristotle</em> calls them τὰ πρὸς τί; the
first whereof is usually named the <em>antecedent</em>, and
the second the <em>consequent</em>; and the <em>relation</em> of the
antecedent to the consequent, according to magnitude,
namely, the equality, the excess or defect
thereof, is called the <span class='fss'>PROPORTION</span> of the antecedent
to the consequent; so that <em>proportion</em> is
nothing but the equality or inequality of the magnitude
of the antecedent compared to the magnitude
of the consequent by their difference only,
or compared also with their difference. For example,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>the <em>proportion</em> of three to two consists
only in this, that three <em>exceeds</em> two by unity; and
the proportion of two to five in this, that two,
compared with five, is <em>deficient</em> of it by three,
either simply, or compared with the numbers different;
and therefore in the proportion of unequals,
the proportion of the less to the greater, is called <span class='fss'>DEFECT</span>;
and that of the greater to the less, <span class='fss'>EXCESS</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proportionals, what.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art11.4'></a>4. Besides, of unequals, some are more, some
less, and some equally unequal; so that there is
<em>proportion of proportions</em>, as well as of <em>magnitudes</em>;
namely, where two unequals have relation
to two other unequals; as, when the inequality
which is between 2 and 3, is compared with the
inequality which is between 4 and 5. In which
comparison there are always four magnitudes; or,
which is all one, if there be but three, the middlemost
is twice numbered; and if the proportion of
the first to the second, be equal to the proportion
of the third to the fourth, then the four are said
to be <em>proportionals</em>; otherwise they are not proportionals.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The proportion of magnitudes to one another, wherein it consists.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art11.5'></a>5. The proportion of the antecedent to the consequent
consists in their difference, not only
simply taken, but also as compared with one of
the relatives; that is, either in that part of the
greater, by which it exceeds the less, or in the remainder,
after the less is taken out of the greater;
as the proportion of two to five consists in the
three by which five exceeds two, not in three
simply only, but also as compared with five or two.
For though there be the same difference between
two and five, which is between nine and twelve,
namely three, yet there is not the same inequality;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and therefore the proportion of two to five is not
in all relation the same with that of nine to twelve,
but only in that which is called arithmetical.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Relation is no new accident, but one of those that were in the relative, before the relation or comparison was made. Also the causes of accidents in correlatives are the cause of relation.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art11.6'></a>6. But we must not so think of relation, as if it
were an accident differing from all the other accidents
of the relative; but one of them, namely,
that by which the comparison is made. For example,
the likeness of one <em>white</em> to another <em>white</em>,
or its unlikeness to <em>black</em>, is the same accident
with its <em>whiteness</em>; and <em>equality</em> and <em>inequality</em>,
the same accident with the <em>magnitude</em> of the thing
compared, though under another name: for that
which is called <em>white</em> or <em>great</em>, when it is not compared
with something else, the same when it is
compared, is called <em>like</em> or <em>unlike</em>, <em>equal</em> or <em>unequal</em>.
And from this it follows that the causes
of the accidents, which are in relatives, are the
causes also of <em>likeness</em>, <em>unlikeness</em>, <em>equality</em> and
<em>inequality</em>; namely, that he, that makes two unequal
bodies, makes also their inequality; and he, that
makes a rule and an action, makes also, if the
action be congruous to the rule, their congruity;
if incongruous, their incongruity. And thus much
concerning <em>comparison</em> of one body with another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the beginning of individuation.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art11.7'></a>7. But the same body may at different times be
compared with itself. And from hence springs a
great controversy among philosophers about the
<em>beginning of individuation</em>, namely, in what sense
it may be conceived that a body is at one time the
same, at another time not the same it was formerly.
For example, whether a man grown old be the
same man he was whilst he was young, or another
man; or whether a city be in different ages the
same, or another city. Some place <em>individuity</em> in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the unity of <em>matter</em>; others, in the unity of <em>form</em>;
and one says it consists in the unity of the <em>aggregate
of all the accidents together</em>. For <em>matter</em>,
it is pleaded that a lump of wax, whether it be
spherical or cubical, is the same wax, because the
same matter. For <em>form</em>, that when a man is grown
from an infant to be an old man, though his matter
be changed, yet he is still the same numerical
man; for that <em>identity</em> which cannot be attributed
to the matter, ought probably to be ascribed to the
form. For the <em>aggregate of accidents</em>, no instance
can be made; but because, when any new accident
is generated, a new name is commonly imposed on
the thing, therefore he, that assigned this cause of
<em>individuity</em>, thought the thing itself also was
become another thing. According to the first
opinion, he that sins, and he that is punished,
should not be the same man, by reason of the perpetual
flux and change of man's body; nor should
the city, which makes laws in one age and abrogates
them in another, be the same city; which
were to confound all civil rights. According to
the second opinion, two bodies existing both at
once, would be one and the same numerical body.
For if, for example, that ship of Theseus, concerning
the difference whereof made by continual reparation
in taking out the old planks and putting
in new, the sophisters of Athens were wont to dispute,
were, after all the planks were changed, the
same numerical ship it was at the beginning; and
if some man had kept the old planks as they were
taken out, and by putting them afterwards together
in the same order, had again made a ship of them,
this, without doubt, had also been the same numerical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>ship with that which was at the beginning;
and so there would have been two ships numerically
the same, which is absurd. But, according to the
third opinion, nothing would be the same it
was; so that a man standing would not be the same
he was sitting; nor the water, which is in the vessel,
the same with that which is poured out of it.
Wherefore the beginning of <em>individuation</em> is not
always to be taken either from matter alone, or
from form alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we must consider by what name anything
is called, when we inquire concerning the <em>identity</em>
of it. For it is one thing to ask concerning Socrates,
whether he be the same man, and another to ask
whether he be the same body; for his body, when
he is old, cannot be the same it was when he was
an infant, by reason of the difference of magnitude;
for one body has always one and the same magnitude;
yet, nevertheless, he may be the same man.
And therefore, whensoever the name, by which it
is asked whether a thing be the same it was, is
given it for the matter only, then, if the matter be
the same, the thing also is <em>individually</em> the same;
as the water, which was in the sea, is the same
which is afterwards in the cloud; and any body is
the same, whether the parts of it be put together,
or dispersed; or whether it be congealed, or dissolved.
Also, if the name be given for such form
as is the beginning of motion, then, as long as that
motion remains, it will be the same <em>individual</em>
thing; as that man will be always the same, whose
actions and thoughts proceed all from the same
beginning of motion, namely, that which was in
his generation; and that will be the same river
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>which flows from one and the same fountain,
whether the same water, or other water, or something
else than water, flow from thence; and that
the same city, whose acts proceed continually from
the same institution, whether the men be the same
or no. Lastly, if the name be given for some
accident, then the <em>identity</em> of the thing will depend
upon the matter; for, by the taking away and
supplying of matter, the accidents that were, are
destroyed, and other new ones are generated,
which cannot be the same numerically; so that a
ship, which signifies matter so figured, will be the
same as long as the matter remains the same; but
if no part of the matter be the same, then it is
numerically another ship; and if part of the matter
remain and part be changed, then the ship will
be partly the same, and partly not the same.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Definition of quantity.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art12.1'></a>1. What and how manifold <em>dimension</em> is, has
been said in the 8th chapter, namely, that there are
three dimensions, line or length, superficies, and
solid; every one of which, if it be determined, that
is, if the limits of it be made known, is commonly
called <em>quantity</em>; for by <em>quantity</em> all men understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>that which is signified by that word, by
which answer is made to the question, <em>How much
is it?</em> Whensoever, therefore, it is asked, for
example, <em>How long is the journey?</em> it is not
answered indefinitely, <em>length</em>; nor, when it is
asked, <em>How big is the field?</em> is it answered indefinitely,
<em>superficies</em>; nor, if a man ask, <em>How great
is the bulk?</em> indefinitely, <em>solid</em>: but it is answered
determinately, the journey is a hundred miles; the
field is a hundred acres; the bulk is a hundred
cubical feet; or at least in some such manner, that
the magnitude of the thing enquired after may
by certain limits be comprehended in the mind.
<span class='fss'>QUANTITY</span>, therefore, cannot otherwise be defined,
than to be <em>a dimension determined</em>, or <em>a dimension,
whose limits are set out, either by their
place, or by some comparison</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The exposition of quantity, what it is.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art12.2'></a>2. And <em>quantity</em> is determined two ways; one,
by the sense, when some sensible object is set
before it; as when a line, a superficies or solid,
of a foot or cubit, marked out in some matter, is
objected to the eyes; which way of determining,
is called <em>exposition</em>, and the quantity so known
is called <em>exposed quantity</em>; the other by memory,
that is, by comparison with some exposed quantity.
In the first manner, when it is asked of what
quantity a thing is, it is answered, of such quantity
as you see exposed. In the second manner, answer
cannot be made but by comparison with some
exposed quantity; for if it be asked, how long is
the way? the answer is, so many thousand paces;
that is, by comparing the way with a pace, or some
other measure, determined and known by exposition;
or the quantity of it is to some other quantity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>known by exposition, as the diameter of a
square is to the side of the same, or by some
other the like means. But it is to be understood,
that the quantity exposed must be some standing
or permanent thing, such as is marked out in
consistent or durable matter; or at least something
which is revocable to sense; for otherwise no comparison
can be made by it. Seeing, therefore, by
what has been said in the next preceding chapter,
comparison of one magnitude with another is the
same thing with proportion; it is manifest, that
quantity determined in the second manner is
nothing else but the proportion of a dimension not
exposed to another which is exposed; that is, the
comparison of the equality or inequality thereof
with an exposed quantity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How line, superficies, and solids, are exposed.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art12.3'></a>3. <em>Lines</em>, <em>superficies</em>, and <em>solids</em>, are exposed,
first, by <em>motion</em>, in such manner as in the 8th
chapter I have said they are generated; but so as
that the marks of such motion be permanent; as
when they are designed upon some matter, as a
line upon paper; or graven in some durable
matter. Secondly, by <em>apposition</em>; as when one
line or length is applied to another line or length,
one breadth to another breadth, and one thickness
to another thickness; which is as much as to
describe a line by points, a superficies by lines,
and a solid by superficies; saving that by points
in this place are to be understood very short
lines; and, by superficies, very thin solids.
Thirdly, lines and superficies may be exposed by
<em>section</em>, namely, a line may be made by cutting
an exposed superficies; and a superficies, by the
cutting of an exposed solid.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How time is exposed.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span><a id='art12.4'></a>4. <em>Time</em> is exposed, not only by the exposition
of a line, but also of some moveable thing, which
is moved uniformly upon that line, or at least is
supposed so to be moved. For, seeing time is an
idea of motion, in which we consider former and
latter, that is succession, it is not sufficient for the
exposition of time that a line be described; but
we must also have in our mind an imagination of
some moveable thing passing over that line; and
the motion of it must be uniform, that time may
be divided and compounded as often as there shall
be need. And, therefore, when philosophers, in
their demonstrations, draw a line, and say, <em>Let
that line be time</em>, it is to be understood as if they
said, <em>Let the conception of uniform motion upon
that line, be time</em>. For though the circles in dials
be lines, yet they are not of themselves sufficient
to note time by, except also there be, or be supposed
to be, a motion of the shadow or the hand.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How number is exposed.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art12.5'></a>5. <em>Number</em> is exposed, either by the exposition
of points, or of the names of number, <em>one</em>, <em>two</em>,
<em>three</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i>; and those points must not be contiguous,
so as that they cannot be distinguished by
notes, but they must be so placed that they may
be <em>discerned</em> one from another; for, from this it
is, that number is called <em>discreet quantity</em>,
whereas all quantity, which is designed by motion,
is called <em>continual quantity</em>. But that number
may be exposed by the names of number, it is
necessary that they be recited by heart and in
order, as one, two, three, &#38;c.; for by saying one,
one, one, and so forward, we know not what
number we are at beyond two or three; which
also appear to us in this manner, not as number,
but as figure.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How velocity is exposed.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span><a id='art12.6'></a>6. For the exposition of <em>velocity</em>, which, by the
definition thereof, is a motion which, in a certain
time, passeth over a certain space, it is requisite,
not only that time be exposed, but that there be
also exposed that space which is transmitted by
the body, whose velocity we would determine;
and that a body be understood to be moved in
that space also; so that there must be exposed two
lines, upon one of which uniform motion must be
understood to be made, that the time may be determined;
and, upon the other, the velocity is to be computed.
<span class='sni diagram'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;B<br>C&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;D<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
As if we would expose the velocity of the
we would expose the velocity of the
body A, we draw two lines A B
and C D, and place a body in C also; which done,
we say the velocity of the body A is so great,
that it passeth over the line A B in the same time
in which the body C passeth over the line C D
with uniform motion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How weight is exposed.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art12.7'></a>7. <em>Weight</em> is exposed by any heavy body, of
what matter soever, so it be always alike heavy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How the proportion of magnitudes is exposed.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art12.8'></a>8. The <em>proportion</em> of two magnitudes is then
exposed, when the magnitudes themselves are exposed,
namely, the proportion of equality, when
the magnitudes are equal; and of inequality, when
they are unequal. For seeing, by the 5th article
of the preceding chapter, the proportion of two
unequal magnitudes consists in their difference,
compared with either of them; and when two unequal
magnitudes are exposed, their difference is
also exposed; it follows, that when magnitudes,
which have proportion to one another, are exposed,
their proportion also is exposed with them;
and, in like manner, the proportion of equals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>which consists in this, that there is no difference
of magnitude betwixt them, is exposed at the
same time when the equal magnitudes themselves
are exposed. For example, if the exposed lines
A B and C D be equal, the proportion
of equality is exposed in them;
<span class='sni diagram'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;B<br>C&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;D<br>E&#160;&#160;G&#160;&#160;F<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and if the exposed lines, E F and E G
be unequal, the proportion which
E F has to E G, and that which E G
has to E F are also exposed in them; for not only
the lines themselves, but also their difference, G F,
is exposed. The proportion of unequals is quantity;
for the difference, G F, in which it consists,
is quantity. But the proportion of equality is not
quantity; because, between equals, there is no
difference; nor is one equality greater than another,
as one inequality is greater than another inequality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How the proportion of times and velocities is exposed.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art12.9'></a>9. The proportion of two <em>times</em>, or of two <em>uniform
velocities</em>, is then exposed, when two lines
are exposed by which two bodies are understood
to be moved uniformly; and therefore the same
two lines serve to exhibit both their own proportion,
and that of the times and velocities, according
as they are considered to be exposed for the
magnitudes themselves, or for the times or velocities.
For let the two lines A and B be exposed;
<span class='sni diagram'><span class='hidev'>|</span>&#160;A&#160;<br>&#160;B&#160;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
their proportion therefore (by the
last foregoing article) is exposed; and if
they be considered as drawn with equal
and uniform velocity, then, seeing their times are
greater, or equal, or less, according as the same
spaces are transmitted in greater, or equal, or
less time, the lines A and B will exhibit the
equality or inequality, that is, the proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of the times. To conclude, if the same lines, A
and B, be considered as drawn in the same time,
then, seeing their velocities are greater, or equal,
or less, according as they pass over in the same
time longer, or equal, or shorter lines, the same
lines, A and B, will exhibit the equality, or inequality,
that is, the proportion of their velocities.</p>

</div>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The nature and definition of proportion, arithmetical &#38; geometrical.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.1'></a>1. Great and little are not intelligible, but by comparison.
Now that, to which they are compared,
is something exposed; that is, some magnitude
either perceived by sense, or so defined by words,
that it may be comprehended by the mind. Also
that, to which any magnitude is compared, is either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>greater or less, or equal to it. And therefore proportion
(which, as I have shewn, is the estimation
or comprehension of magnitudes by comparison,)
is threefold, namely, proportion of <em>equality</em>, that
is, of equal to equal; or of <em>excess</em>, which is of the
greater to the less; or of <em>defect</em>, which is the proportion
of the less to the greater.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, every one of these proportions is two-fold;
for if it be asked concerning any magnitude
given, how great it is, the answer may be made
by comparing it two ways; first, by saying it is
greater or less than another magnitude, by so
much; as seven is less than ten, by three unities;
and this is called <em>arithmetical proportion</em>. Secondly,
by saying it is greater or less than another
magnitude, by such a part or parts thereof; as
seven is less than ten, by three tenth parts of the
same ten. And though this proportion be not
always explicable by number, yet it is a determinate
proportion, and of a different kind from
the former, and called <em>geometrical proportion</em>,
and most commonly <em>proportion simply</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.2'></a>2. Proportion, whether it be arithmetical or
geometrical, cannot be exposed but in two magnitudes,
(of which the former is commonly called the
<em>antecedent</em>, and the latter the <em>consequent</em> of the
proportion) as I have shewn in the <a href='#art13.8'>8th article</a> of
the preceding chapter. And, therefore, if two
proportions be to be compared, there must be four
magnitudes exposed, namely, two antecedents and
two consequents; for though it happen sometimes
that the consequent of the former proportion be
the same with the antecedent of the latter, yet in
that double comparison it must of necessity be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>twice numbered; so that there will be always four
terms.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.3'></a>3. Of two proportions, whether they be arithmetical
or geometrical, when the magnitudes compared
in both (which Euclid, in the fifth definition
of his sixth book, calls the <em>quantities of proportions</em>,)
are equal, then one of the proportions
cannot be either greater or less than the other;
for one equality is neither greater nor less than
another equality. But of two proportions of inequality,
whether they be proportions of excess or
of defect, one of them may be either greater or less
than the other, or they may both be equal; for
though there be propounded two magnitudes that
are unequal to one another, yet there may be
other two more, unequal, and other two equally
unequal, and other two less unequal than the two
which were propounded. And from hence it may
be understood, that the proportions of excess and
defect are quantity, being capable of more and
less; but the proportion of equality is not quantity,
because not capable neither of <em>more</em>, nor of
<em>less</em>. And therefore proportions of inequality may
be added together, or subtracted from one another,
or be multiplied or divided by one another, or by
number; but proportions of equality not so.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.4'></a>4. Two equal proportions are commonly called
<em>the same proportion</em>; and, it is said, that the
proportion of the first antecedent to the first
consequent is the <em>same</em> with that of the second
antecedent to the second consequent. And when
four magnitudes are thus to one another in geometrical
proportion, they are called <em>proportionals</em>;
and by some, more briefly, <em>analogism</em>. And <em>greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>proportion</em> is the proportion of a greater antecedent
to the same consequent, or of the same
antecedent to a less consequent; and when the
proportion of the first antecedent to the first consequent
is greater than that of the second antecedent
to the second consequent, the four magnitudes,
which are so to one another, may be called
<em>hyperlogism</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Less proportion</em> is the proportion of a less antecedent
to the same consequent, or of the same
antecedent to a greater consequent; and when the
proportion of the first antecedent to the first consequent
is less than that of the second to the second,
the four magnitudes may be called <em>hypologism</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The definition and some properties of the same arithmetical proportion.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.5'></a>5. One arithmetical proportion is the <em>same</em> with
another arithmetical proportion, when one of the
antecedents exceeds its consequent, or is exceeded
by it, as much as the other antecedent exceeds its
consequent, or is exceeded by it. And therefore,
in four magnitudes, arithmetically proportional,
the sum of the extremes is equal to the sum of the
means. For if A. B :: C. D be arithmetically proportional,
and the difference on both sides be the
same excess, or the same defect, E, then B + C (if
A be greater than B) will be equal to A - E + C;
and A + D will be equal to A + C - E; but A - E + C
and A + C - E are equal. Or if A be less than B,
then B + C will be equal to A + E + C; and A + D
will be equal to A + C + E; but A + E + C and A + C + E
are equal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Also, if there be never so many magnitudes,
arithmetically proportional, the sum of them all
will be equal to the product of half the number of
the terms multiplied by the sum of the extremes.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>For if A. B :: C. D :: E. F be arithmetically proportional,
the couples A + F, B + E, C + D will be
equal to one another; and their sum will be equal
to A + F, multiplied by the number of their combinations,
that is, by half the number of the terms.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, of four unequal magnitudes, any two, together
taken, be equal to the other two together taken,
then the greatest and the least of them will be in
the same combination. Let the unequal magnitudes
be A, B, C, D; and let A + B be equal to
C + D; and let A be the greatest of them all; I say
B will be the least. For, if it may be, let any of
the rest, as D, be the least. Seeing therefore A
is greater than C, and B than D, A+B will be
greater than C + D; which is contrary to what was
supposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>If there be any four magnitudes, the sum of the
greatest and least, the sum of the means, the
difference of the two greatest, and the difference
of the two least, will be arithmetically proportional.
For, let there be four magnitudes, whereof
A is the greatest, D the least, and B and C the
means; I say A + D. B + C :: A - B. C - D are
arithmetically proportional. For the difference
between the first antecedent and its consequent is
this, A + D - B - C; and the difference between
the second antecedent and its consequent this,
A - B - C + D; but these two differences are equal;
and therefore, by this 5th article, A + D. B + C ::
A - B. C - D are arithmetically proportional.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, of four magnitudes, two be equal to the other
two, they will be in reciprocal arithmetical proportion.
For let A + B be equal to C + D, I say
A. C :: D. B are arithmetically proportional. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>if they be not, let A. C :: D. E (supposing E to be
greater or less than B) be arithmetically proportional,
and then A + E will be equal to C + D;
wherefore A + B and C + D are not equal; which is
contrary to what was supposed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The definition and transmutations of analogism, or the same geometrical proportion.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.6'></a>6. One geometrical proportion is the same with
another geometrical proportion; when the same
cause, producing equal effects in equal times, determines
both the proportions.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a point uniformly moved describe two lines,
either with the same, or different velocity, all the
parts of them which are contemporary, that is,
which are described in the same time, will be two
to two, in geometrical proportion, whether the
antecedents be taken in the same line, or not.
<a id='fig14.10'></a>For, from the point A (in the <a href='#fig14.f10'>10th figure</a> at the
end of the 14th chapter) let the two lines, A D,
A G, be described with uniform motion; and let
there be taken in them two parts A B, A E, and
again, two other parts, A C, A F; in such manner,
that A B, A E, be contemporary, and likewise
A C, A F contemporary. I say first (taking the
antecedents A B, A C in the line A D, and the conquents
A E, A F in the line A G) that A B. A C ::
A E. A F are proportionals. For seeing (by the
8th chap, and the <a href='#art8.15'>15th art.</a>) velocity is motion
considered as determined by a certain length or
line, in a certain time transmitted by it, the quantity
of the line A B will be determined by the
velocity and time by which the same A B is described;
and for the same reason, the quantity of
the line A C will be determined by the velocity
and time, by which the same A C is described;
and therefore the proportion of A B to A C, whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>it be proportion of equality, or of excess or
defect, is determined by the velocities and times
by which A B, A C are described; but seeing the
motion of the point A upon A B and A C is uniform,
they are both described with equal velocity;
and therefore whether one of them have to the
other the proportion of majority or of minority,
the sole cause of that proportion is the difference
of their times; and by the same reason it is evident,
that the proportion of A E to A F is determined
by the difference of their times only. Seeing
therefore A B, A E, as also A C, A F are contemporary,
the difference of the times in which A B
and A C are described, is the same with that in
which A E and A F are described. Wherefore the
proportion of A B to A C, and the proportion of
A E to A F are both determined by the same cause.
But the cause, which so determines the proportion
of both, works equally in equal times, for it is uniform
motion; and therefore (by the last precedent
definition) the proportion of A B to A C is the same
with that of A E to A F; and consequently A B.
A C :: A E. A F are proportionals; which is the
first.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, (taking the antecedents in different
lines) I say, A B. A E :: A C. A F are proportionals;
for seeing A B, A E are described in the same
time, the difference of the velocities in which they
are described is the sole cause of the proportion
they have to one another. And the same may be
said of the proportion of A C to A F. But seeing
both the lines A D and A G are passed over by
uniform motion, the difference of the velocities in
which A B, A E are described, will be the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>with the difference of the velocities, in which A C,
A F are described. Wherefore the cause which
determines the proportion of A B to A E, is the
same with that which determines the proportion of
A C to A F; and therefore A B. A E :: A C. A F,
are proportionals; which remained to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor13.6.1'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>I</span>. If four magnitudes be in geometrical
proportion, they will also be proportionals by <em>permutation</em>,
that is, by transposing the middle terms.
For I have shown, that not only A B. A C :: A E.
A F, but also that, by <em>permutation</em>, A B. A E ::
A C. A F are proportionals.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor13.6.2'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>II</span>. If there be four proportionals, they
will also be proportionals by <em>inversion</em> or <em>conversion</em>,
that is, by turning the antecedents into consequents.
For if in the last <em>analogism</em>, I had for
A B, A C, put by inversion A C, A B, and in like
manner converted A E, A F into A F, A E, yet the
same demonstration had served. For as well A C,
A B, as A B, A C are of equal velocity; and A C,
A F, as well as A F, A C are contemporary.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor13.6.3'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>III</span>. If proportionals be added to proportionals,
or taken from them, the aggregates, or
remainders, will be proportionals. For contemporaries,
whether they be added to contemporaries,
or taken from them, make the aggregates or remainders
contemporary, though the addition or
subtraction be of all the terms, or of the antecedents
alone, or of the consequents alone.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor13.6.4'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>IV</span>. If both the antecedents of four proportionals,
or both the consequents, or all the
terms, be multiplied or divided by the same number
or quantity, the products or quotients will be
proportionals. For the multiplication and division
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>of proportionals, is the same with the addition and
subtraction of them.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor13.6.5'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>V</span>. If there be four proportionals, they
will also be proportionals by <em>composition</em>, that is,
by compounding an antecedent of the antecedent
and consequent put together, and by taking for
consequent either the consequent singly, or the
antecedent singly. For this composition is nothing
but addition of proportionals, namely, of consequents
to their own antecedents, which by supposition
are proportionals.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor13.6.6'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>VI</span>. In like manner, if the antecedent
singly, or consequent singly, be put for antecedent,
and the consequent be made of both put together,
these also will be proportionals. For it is the <em>inversion
of proportion by composition</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor13.6.7'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>VII</span>. If there be four proportionals, they
will also be proportionals by division, that is, by
taking the remainder after the consequent is subtracted
from the antecedent, or the difference
between the antecedent and consequent for antecedent,
and either the whole or the subtracted for
consequent; as if A. B :: C. D be proportionals,
they will by division be A - B. B :: C - D. D, and
A - B. A :: C - D. C; and when the consequent is
greater than the antecedent, B - A. A :: D - C. C,
and B - A. B :: D - C. D. For in all these divisions,
proportionals are, by the very supposition of the
analogism A. B :: C. D, taken from A and B, and
from C and D.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor13.6.8'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>VIII</span>. If there be four proportionals, they
will also be proportionals by the <em>conversion of
proportion</em>, that is, by inverting the divided proportion,
or by taking the whole for antecedent,
and the difference or remainder for consequent.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>As, if A. B :: C. D be proportionals, then A. A - B
:: C. C - D, as also B. A - B :: D. C - D will be
proportionals. For seeing these inverted be proportionals,
they are also themselves proportionals.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor13.6.9'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>IX</span>. If there be two analogisms which
have their quantities equal, the second to the second,
and the fourth to the fourth, then either the
sum or difference of the first quantities will be to
the second, as the sum or difference of the third
quantities is to the fourth. Let A. B :: C. D and
E. B :: F. D be analogisms; I say A + E. B :: C + F. D
are proportionals. For the said analogisms will
by permutation be A. C :: B. D, and E. F :: B. D;
and therefore A. C :: E. F will be proportionals,
for they have both the proportion of B to D common.
Wherefore, if in the permutation of the
first analogism, there be added E and F to A and
C, which E and F are proportional to A and C,
then (by the third coroll.) A + E. B :: C + F. D will
be proportionals; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Also in the same manner it may be shown, that

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.7'></a>7. If there be two analogisms, where four antecedents
make an analogism, their consequents
also shall make an analogism; as also the sums of
their antecedents will be proportional to the sums
of their consequents. For if A. B :: C. D and
E. F :: G. H be two analogisms, and A. E :: C. G be
proportionals, then by permutation A. C :: E. G,
and E. G :: F. H, and A. C :: B. D will be proportionals;
wherefore B. D :: E. G, that is, B. D :: F. H,
and by permutation B. F :: D. H are proportionals;
which is the first. Secondly, I say A + E. B + F ::
C + G. D + H will be proportionals. For seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>A. E :: C. G are proportionals, A + E. E :: C + G. G
will also by composition be proportionals, and by

wherefore, also A + E. C + G :: B + F. D + H will

B. F :: D. H are proportionals, B + F. F :: D + H. H
will also by composition be proportionals; and by

wherefore A + E. C + G :: B + F. D + H
are proportionals; which remained to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. By the same reason, if there be never so

to the sum of the consequents.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The definition of hyperlogism and hypologism, that is, of greater and less proportion, and their transmutations.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.8'></a>8. In an hyperlogism, that is, where the proportion
of the first antecedent to its consequent
is greater than the proportion of the second antecedent
to its consequent, the permutation of the
proportionals, and the addition of proportionals to
proportionals, and substraction of them from one
another, as also their composition and division, and
their multiplication and division by the same number,
produce always an hyperlogism. For suppose
A. B :: C . D and A. C :: E. F be analogisms, A + E. B
:: C + F . D will also be an analogism; but A + E.
B :: C. D will be an hyperlogism; wherefore by
permutation, A + E. C :: B. D is an hyperlogism,
because A. B :: C. D is an analogism. Secondly, if
to the hyperlogism A + E. B :: C. D the proportionals
G and H be added, A + E + G. B :: C + H. D
will be an hyperlogism, by reason A + E + G.
B :: C + F + H. D is an analogism. Also, if G and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>H be taken away, A + E - G. B :: C - H. D will be
an hyperlogism; for A + E - G. B :: C + F - H. D
is an analogism. Thirdly, by composition A + E
+ B. B :: C + D. D will be an hyperlogism, because
A + E + B. B :: C + F + D. D is ah analogism, and so
it will be in all the varieties of composition.
Fourthly, by division, A + E - B. B :: C - D. D will
by an hyperlogism, by reason A E - B. B :: C + F
- D. D is an analogism. Also A + E - B. A + E ::
C - D. C is an hyperlogism; for A + E - B. A + E ::
C + F - D. C is an analogism. Fifthly, by multiplication
4 A + 4 E. B :: 4 C. D is an hyperlogism, because
4 A. B :: 4 C. D is an analogism; and by
division ¼ A + ¼ E. B :: ¼ C.D is an hyperlogism,
because ¼ A. B :: ¼ C. D is an analogism.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.9'></a>9. But if A + E. B :: C. D be an hyperlogism,
then by inversion B. A + E :: D. C will be an hypologism,
because B. A :: D. C being an analogism,
the first consequent will be too great. Also,
by conversion of proportion, A + E. A + E - B :: C.
C - D is an hypologism, because the inversion of
it, namely A + E - B. A + E :: C - D. C is an hyperlogism,
as I have shown but now. So also B. A +
E - B :: D. C - D is an hypologism, because, as I
have newly shown, the inversion of it, namely
A + E - B. B :: C - D. D is an hyperlogism. Note
that this hypologism A + E. A + E - B :: C. C - D is
commonly thus expressed; if the proportion of
the whole, (A + E) to that which is taken out of it
(B), be greater than the proportion of the whole
(C) to that which is taken out of it (D), then the
proportion of the whole (A + E) to the remainder
(A + E - B) will be less than the proportion of the
whole (C) to the remainder (C - D).</p>

than the second, the third also shall be greater
than the fourth. For seeing the first is greater
than the second, the proportion of the first to the
second is the proportion of excess; but the proportion
of the third to the fourth is the same with
that of the first to the second; and therefore also
the proportion of the third to the fourth is the
proportion of excess; wherefore the third is greater
than the fourth. In the same manner it may be
proved, that whensoever the first is less than the
second, the third also is less than the fourth; and
when those are equal, that these also are equal.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.12'></a>12. If there be four proportionals whatsoever,

and the product of the first 2 A, be greater than
the product of the second 3 B; the product also
of the third 2 C, will be greater than the product
of the fourth 3 D. But if the product of the first
be less than the product of the second, then the
product of the third will be less than that of the
fourth. And lastly, if the products of the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>and second be equal, the products of the third and
fourth shall also be equal. Now this theorem
is all one with Euclid's definition of <em>the same
proportion</em>; and it may be demonstrated thus.
Seeing A. B :: C. D are proportionals, by permutation
also (art. 6, <a href='#cor13.6.1'>coroll. <span class='fss'>I</span>.</a>) A. C :: B . D will be
proportionals; wherefore (by <a href='#cor13.6.4'>coroll. <span class='fss'>IV</span>. art. 6</a>) 2 A.
2 C :: 3 B. 3 D will be proportionals; and again,
by permutation, 2 A. 3 B :: 2 C. 3 D will be proportionals;
and therefore, by the last article, if
2 A be greater than 3 B, then 2 C will be greater
than 3 D; if less, less; and if equal, equal; which
was to be demonstrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Composition of proportions.</div>

A B, A C, A D; and in the first place, let the proportion
as well of the first A B to the second A C,
as of the second A C to the<span class='sni diagram'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A&#160;&#160;B&#160;&#160;C&#160;&#160;D<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
third AD, be the proportion
of defect, or of less to greater; I say the proportions
together taken of A B to A C, and of A C to
A D, are equal to the proportion of A B to A D.
Suppose the point A to be moved over the whole
line A D with uniform motion; then the proportions
as well of A B to A C, as of A C to A D, are
determined by the difference of the times in which
they are described; that is, A B has to A C such
proportion as is determined by the different times
of their description; and A C to AD such proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>as is determined by their times. But the
proportion of A B to A D is such as is determined
by the difference of the times in which A B and
A D are described; and the difference of the times
in which A B and A C are described, together with
the difference of the times in which A C and A D
are described, is the same with the difference of
the times in which A B and A D are described.
And therefore, the same cause which determines
the two proportions of A B to A C and of A C to
A D, determines also the proportion of A B to
A D. Wherefore, by the definition of the same
proportion, delivered above in the 6th article, the
proportion of A B to A C together with the proportion
of A C to A D, is the same with the proportion
of A B to A D.
In the second place, let A D be the first, A C
the second, and A B the third, and let their proportion
be the proportion of excess, or the greater
to less; then, as before, the proportions of A D to
A C, and of A C to A B, and of A D to A B, will be
determined by the difference of their times; which
in the description of A D and A C, and of A C and
A B together taken, is the same with the difference
of the times in the description of A D and
A B. Wherefore the proportion of A D to A B is
equal to the two proportions of A D to A C and of
A C to A B.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the last place. If one of the proportions,
namely of A D to A B, be the proportion of excess,
and another of them, as of A B to A C be the proportion
of defect, thus also the proportion of A D
to A C will be equal to the two proportions together
taken of A D to A B, and of A B to A C. For
the difference of the times in which AD and AB
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>are described, is excess of time; for there goes
more time to the description of A D than of A B;
and the difference of the times in which A B and
A C are described, is defect of time, for less time
goes to the description of A B than of A C; but
this excess and defect being added together, make
D B - B C, which is equal to D C, by which the
first A D exceeds the third A C; and therefore the
proportions of the first A D to the second A B,
and of the second A B to the third A C, are determined
by the same cause which determines the
proportion of the first A D to the third A C.
Wherefore, if any three magnitudes, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. <span class='fss'>I</span>. If there be never so many magnitudes
having proportion to one another, the proportion
of the first to the last is compounded of the proportions
of the first to the second, of the second
to the third, and so on till you come to the last;
or, the proportion of the first to the last is the
same with the sum of all the intermediate proportions.
For any number of magnitudes having proportion
to one another, as A, B, C, D, E being
propounded, the proportion of A to E, as is newly
shown, is compounded of the proportions of A to D
and of D to E; and again, the proportion of A to
D, of the proportions of A to C, and of C to D;
and lastly, the proportion of A to C, of the proportions
of A to B, and of B to C.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. <span class='fss'>II</span>. From hence it may be understood
how any two proportions may be compounded. For
if the proportions of A to B, and of C to D, be
propounded to be added together, let B have to
something else, as to E, the same proportion which
C has to D, and let them be set in this order,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>A, B, E; for so the proportion of A to E will evidently
be the sum of the two proportions of A to B,
and of B to E, that is, of C to D. Or let it be as
D to C, so A to something else, as to E, and let
them be ordered thus, E, A, B; for the proportion
of E to B will be compounded of the proportions
of E to A, that is, of C to D, and of A to B. Also,
it may be understood how one proportion may be
taken out of another. For if the proportion of C
to D be to be subtracted out of the proportion of
A to B, let it be as C to D, so A to something else,
as E, and setting them in this order, A, E, B, and
taking away the proportion of A to E, that is, of
C to D, there will remain the proportion of E to B.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. <span class='fss'>III</span>. If there be two orders of magnitudes
which have proportion to one another, and the
several proportions of the first order be the same
and equal in number with the proportions of the
second order; then, whether the proportions in
both orders be successively answerable to one another,
which is called <em>ordinate proportion</em>, or not
successively answerable, which is called <em>perturbed
proportion</em>, the first and the last in both will be proportionals.
For the proportion of the first to the
last is equal to all the intermediate proportions;
which being in both orders the same, and equal in
number, the aggregates of those proportions will
also be equal to one another; but to their aggregates,
the proportions of the first to the last are
equal; and therefore the proportion of the first to
the last in one order, is the same with the proportion
of the first to the last in the other order.
Wherefore the first and the last in both are proportionals.</p>

multiplication of many quantities, which have proportion
to one another, and the efficient quantities
on both sides be equal in number, the proportion
of the products will be compounded of the several
proportions, which the efficient quantities have to
one another.</p>

<p class='c001'>First, let the two products be A B and C D,
whereof one is made of the multiplication of A
into B, and the other of the multiplication of C
into D. I say the proportion of A B to C D is
compounded of the proportions of the efficient A
to the efficient C, and of the efficient B to the
efficient D. For let A B, C B and C D be set in
order; and as B is to D, so let C be to another
quantity as E; and let A, C, E be
set also in order. <span class='sni diagramnoline'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A B.&#160;&#160;&#160;A.<br>C B.&#160;&#160;&#160;C<br>C D.&#160;&#160;&#160;E<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Then (by
coroll. <a href='#cor13.6.4'><span class='fss'>IV</span></a>. of the 6th art.) it will
be as A B the first quantity to C B
the second quantity in the first order, so A to C in
the second order; and again, as C B to C D in the
first order, so B to D, that is, by construction,
so C to E in the second order; and therefore (by
the last corollary) A B. C D :: A. E will be proportionals.
But the proportion of A to E is compounded
of the proportions of A to C, and of B to
D; wherefore also the proportion of A B to C D
is compounded of the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, let the two products be A B F, and
C D G, each of them made of three efficients, the
first of A, B and F, and the second of C, D and
G; I say, the proportion of A B F to C D G is
compounded of the proportions of A to C, of B to
D, and of F to G. For let them be set in order as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>before; and as B is to D, so let C be to another
quantity E; and again, as F is to G, so let E be to
another, H; and let the first order stand thus,
ABF, CBF, CDF and CDG; <span class='sni diagramnoline'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A B F.&#160;&#160;&#160;A.<br>C B F.&#160;&#160;&#160;C.<br>C D F.&#160;&#160;&#160;E.<br>C D G.&#160;&#160;H.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and the second order thus,
A, C, E, H. Then the proportion
of A B F to C B F in the
first order, will be as A to C in
the second; and the proportion of CBF to CDF
in the first order, as B to D, that is, as C to E (by
construction) in the second order; and the proportion
of CDF to CDG in the first, as F to G,
that is, as E to H (by construction) in the second
order; and therefore A B F. C D G:: A. H will be
proportionals. But the proportion of A to H is
compounded of the proportions of A to C, B to D,
and F to G. Wherefore the proportion of the
product A B F to C D G is also compounded of the
same. And this operation serves, how many soever
the efficients be that make the quantities given.</p>

<p class='c001'>From hence ariseth another way of compounding
many proportions into one, namely, that which is
supposed in the 5th definition of the 6th book of
Euclid; which is, by multiplying all the antecedents
of the proportions into one another, and in
like manner all the consequents into one another.
And from hence also it is evident, in the first
place, that the cause why parallelograms, which
are made by the duction of two straight lines into
one another, and all solids which are equal to
figures so made, have their proportions compounded
of the proportions of the efficients; and in the
second place, why the multiplication of two or
more fractions into one another is the same thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>with the composition of the proportions of their
several numerators to their several denominators.
For example, if these fractions <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>, <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>, <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> be to be
multiplied into one another, the numerators 1, 2, 3,
are first to be multiplied into one another, which
make 6; and next the denominators 2, 3, 4, which
make 24; and these two products make the fraction
<sup>6</sup>⁄<sub>24</sub>. In like manner, if the proportions of 1
to 2, of 2 to 3, and of 3 to 4, be to be compounded,
by working as I have shown above, the same proportion
of 6 to 24 will be produced.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.15'></a>15. If any proportion be compounded with itself
inverted, the compound will be the proportion of
equality. For let any proportion be given, as of
A to B, and let the inverse of it be that of C to D;
and as C to D, so let B be to another quantity;
for thus they will be compounded (by the second
coroll. of the 12th art.) Now seeing the proportion
of C to D is the inverse of the proportion of
A to B, it will be as C to D, so B to A; and therefore
if they be placed in order, A, B, A, the proportion
compounded of the proportions of A to B, and
of C to D, will be the proportion of A to A, that
is, the proportion of equality. And from hence
the cause is evident why two equal products have
their efficients reciprocally proportional. For, for
the making of two products equal, the proportions
of their efficients must be such, as being compounded
may make the proportion of equality,
which cannot be except one be the inverse of the
other; for if betwixt A and A any other quantity,
as C, be interposed, their order will be A, C, A, and
the later proportion of C to A will be the inverse
of the former proportion of A to C.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The definition and properties of continual proportion.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span><a id='art13.16'></a>16. A proportion is said to be multiplied by a
number, when it is so often taken as there be
unities in that number; and if the proportion be
of the greater to the less, then shall also the
quantity of the proportion be increased by the
multiplication; but when the proportion is of the
less to the greater, then as the number increaseth,
the quantity of the proportion diminisheth; as in
these three numbers, 4, 2, 1, the proportion of 4 to
1 is not only the duplicate of 4 to 2, but also twice
as great; but inverting the order of those numbers
thus, 1, 2, 4, the proportion of 1 to 2 is greater
than that of 1 to 4; and therefore though the
proportion of 1 to 4 be the duplicate of 1 to 2, yet
it is not twice so great as that of 1 to 2, but contrarily
the half of it. In like manner, a proportion
is said to be divided, when between two quantities
are interposed one or more means in continual
proportion, and then the proportion of the first to
the second is said to be subduplicate of that of the
first to the third, and subtriplicate of that of the
first to the fourth, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>This mixture of proportions, where some are
proportions of excess, others of defect, as in a
merchant's account of debtor and creditor, is not
so easily reckoned as some think; but maketh the
composition of proportions sometimes to be addition,
sometimes substraction; which soundeth
absurdly to such as have always by composition
understood addition, and by diminution substraction.
Therefore to make this account a little
clearer, we are to consider (that which is commonly
assumed, and truly) that if there be never
so many quantities, the proportion of the first to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>the last is compounded of the proportions of the
first to the second, and of the second to the third,
and so on to the last, without regarding their
equality, excess, or defect; so that if two proportions,
one of inequality, the other of equality, be
added together, the proportion is not thereby made
greater nor less; as for example, if the proportions
of A to B and of B to B be compounded, the proportion
of the first to the second is as much as the
sum of both, because proportion of equality, being
not quantity, neither augmenteth quantity nor
lesseneth it. But if there be three quantities,
A, B, C, unequal, and the first be the greatest, the
last least, then the proportion of B to C is an addition
to that of A to B, and makes it greater;
and on the contrary, if A be the least, and C the
greatest quantity, then doth the addition of the
proportion of B to C make the compounded proportion
of A to C less than the proportion of A to
B, that is, the whole less than the part. The composition
therefore of proportions is not in this case
the augmentation of them, but the diminution;
for the same quantity (Euclid <span class='fss'>V</span>. 8) compared with
two other quantities, hath a greater proportion to
the lesser of them than to the greater. Likewise,
when the proportions compounded are one of
excess, the other of defect, if the first be of excess,
as in these numbers, 8, 6, 9, the proportion compounded,
namely, of 8 to 9, is less than the proportion
of one of the parts of it, namely, of 8
to 6; but if the proportion of the first to the
second be of defect, and that of the second to
the third be of excess, as in these numbers, 6, 8, 4,
then shall the proportion of the first to the third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>be greater than that of the first to the second, as
6 hath a greater proportion to 4 than to 8; the
reason whereof is manifestly this, that the less any
quantity is deficient of another, or the more one
exceedeth another, the proportion of it to that
other is the greater.
Suppose now three quantities in continual proportion,
A B 4, A C 6, A D 9. Because therefore
A D is greater than A C, but not greater than A D,
the proportion of A D to AC will be (by Euclid,
<span class='fss'>V</span>. 8) greater than that of A D to A D; and likewise,
because the proportions of A D to A C, and
of A C to A B are the same, the proportions of A D
to A C and of A C to A B, being both proportions
of excess, make the whole proportion of A D to
A B, or of 9 to 4, not only the duplicate of A D to
A C, that is, of 9 to 6, but also the double, or
twice so great. On the other side, because the
proportion of A D to A D, or 9 to 9, being proportion
of equality, is no quantity, and yet greater
than that of A C to A D, or 6 to 9, it will be as 0 - 9
to 0 - 6, so A C to A D, and again, as 0 - 9 to 0 - 6,
so 0 - 6 to 0 - 4; but 0 - 4, 0 - 6, 0 - 9 are in continual
proportion; and because 0 - 4 is greater
than 0 - 6, the proportion of 0 - 4 to 0 - 6 will be
double to the proportion of 0 - 4 to 0 - 9, double I
say, and yet not duplicate, but subduplicate.</p>

<p class='c001'>If any be unsatisfied with this ratiocination, let
him first consider that (by Euclid <span class='fss'>V</span>. 8) the proportion
of A B to A C is greater than that of A B to
A D, wheresoever D be <span class='sni diagramnoline'><span class='hidev'>|</span>&#160;&#160;Ḅ&#160;&#160;C̣&#160;&#160;&#160;Ḍ<br>A——————E<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
placed in the line A C
prolonged; and the
further off the point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>D is from C, so much the greater is the proportion
of A B to A C than that of A B to A D. There is
therefore some point (which suppose be E) in such
distance from C, as that the proportion of A B to
A C will be twice as great as that of A B to A E.
That considered, let him determine the length of
the line A E, and demonstrate, if he can, that A E
is greater or less than A D.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the same method, if there be more quantities
than three, as A, B, C, D, in continual proportion,
and A be the least, it may be made appear that
the proportion of A to B is triple magnitude,
though subtriple in multitude, to the proportion of
A to D.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.17'></a>17. If there be never so many quantities, the
number whereof is odd, and their order such, that
from the middlemost quantity both ways they
proceed in continual proportion, the proportion of
the two which are next on either side to the middlemost
is subduplicate to the proportion of the
two which are next to these on both sides, and
subtriplicate of the proportion of the two which
are yet one place more remote, &#38;c. For let the
magnitudes be C, B, A, D, E, and let A, B, C, as
also A, D, E be in continual proportion; I say
the proportion of D to B is subduplicate of the
proportion of E to C. For the proportion of D to
B is compounded of the proportions of D to A, and
of A to B once taken; but the proportion of E to
C is compounded of the same twice taken; and
therefore the proportion of D to B is subduplicate
of the proportion of E to C. And in the same
manner, if there were three terms on either side,
it might be demonstrated that the proportion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>D to B would be subtriplicate of that of the extremes,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.18'></a>18. If there be never so many continual proportionals,
as the first, second, third, &#38;c. their differences
will be proportional to them. For the second,
third, &#38;c. are severally consequents of the preceding,
and antecedents of the following proportion. But
(by <a href='#art13.10'>art. 10</a>) the difference of the first antecedent
and consequent, to difference of the second antecedent
and consequent, is as the first antecedent to
the second antecedent, that is, as the first term to
the second, or as the second to the third, &#38;c. in
continual proportionals.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.19'></a>19. If there be three continual proportionals,
the sum of the extremes, together with the mean
twice taken, the sum of the mean and either of
the extremes, and the same extreme, are continual
proportionals. For let A. B. C be continual
proportionals. Seeing, therefore, A. B :: B. C are
proportionals, by composition also A + B. B :: B + C.
C will be proportionals; and by permutation A + B.
B + C :: B. C will also be proportionals; and again,
by composition A + 2B + C. B + C :: B + C. C; which
was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.20'></a>20. In four continual proportionals, the greatest
and the least put together is a greater quantity
than the other two put together. Let A. B :: C. D
be continual proportionals; whereof let the greatest
be A, and the least be D; I say A + D is greater
than B + C. For by <a href='#art13.10'>art. 10</a>, A - B. C - D :: A. C
are proportionals; and therefore A - B is, by <a href='#art13.11'>art. 11</a>, greater than C - D. Add B on both sides, and
A will be greater than C + B - D. And again, add
D on both sides, and A + D will be greater than
B + C; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span><a id='art13.21'></a>21. If there be four proportionals, the extremes
multiplied into one another, and the means multiplied
into one another, will make equal products.
Let A. B :: C. D be proportionals; I say A D is
equal to B C. For the proportion of A D to B C
is compounded, by <a href='#art13.13'>art. 13</a>, of the proportions of
A to B, and D to C, that is, its inverse B to A;
and therefore, by <a href='#art13.14'>art. 14</a>, this compounded proportion
is the proportion of equality; and therefore
also, the proportion of A D to B C is the proportion
of equality. Wherefore they are equal.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.22'></a>22. If there be four quantities, and the proportion
of the first to the second be duplicate of the
proportion of the third to the fourth, the product
of the extremes to the product of the means, will
be as the third to the fourth. Let the four quantities
be A, B, C and D; and let the proportion of
A to B be duplicate of the proportion of C to D,
I say A D, that is, the product of A into D is to
B C, that is, to the product of the means, as C to D.
For seeing the proportion of A to B is duplicate of
the proportion of C to D, if it be as C to D, so D
to another, E, then A. B :: C. E will be proportionals;
for the proportion of A to B is by supposition
duplicate of the proportion of C to D; and
C to E duplicate also of that of C to D by the definition,
<a href='#art13.15'>art. 15</a>. Wherefore, by the last <a href='#art13.21'>article</a>, A E
or A into E is equal to B C or B into C; but, by
coroll. <span class='fss'>IV</span>. <a href='#cor13.6.4'>art. 6</a>, A D is to A E as D to E, that is,
as C to D; and therefore A D is to B C, which as
I have shown is equal to A E, as C to D; which
was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, if the proportion of the first A to
the second B be triplicate of the proportion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the third C to the fourth D, the product of the
extremes to the product of the means will be
duplicate of the proportion of the third to the
fourth. For if it be as C to D so D to E, and
again, as D to E so E to another, F, then the
proportion of C to F will be triplicate of the proportion
of C to D; and consequently, A. B :: C. F
will be proportionals, and A F equal to B C. But
as A D to A F, so is D to F; and therefore, also,
as A D to B C, so D to F, that is, so C to E; but
the proportion of C to E is duplicate of the proportion
of C to D; wherefore, also, the proportion
of A D to B C is duplicate of that of C to D, as was
propounded.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.23'></a>23. If there be four proportionals, and a mean
be interposed betwixt the first and second, and
another betwixt the third and fourth, the first of
these means will be to the second, as the first of
the proportionals is to the third, or as the second
of them is to the fourth. For let A. B :: C. D be
proportionals, and let E be a mean betwixt A and
B, and F a mean betwixt C and D; I say A. C ::
E. F are proportionals. For the proportion of A
to E is subduplicate of the proportion of A to B,
or of C to D. Also, the proportion of C to F is
subduplicate of that of C to D; and therefore
A. E :: C. F are proportionals; and by permutation
A. C :: E. F are also proportionals; which was to
be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.24'></a>24. Any thing is said to be divided into extreme
and mean proportion, when the whole and the
parts are in continual proportion. As for example,
when A + B. A. B are continual proportionals; or
when the straight line A C is so divided in B, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>A C. A B. B C are in continual proportion. And if
the same line A C be again divided
<span class='sni diagramnoline'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A       B   C<br>——+——+——<br>    D<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in D, so as that A C. C D. A D be
continual proportionals; then also
A C. A B. A D will be continual proportionals;
and in like manner, though in contrary order,
C A. C D. C B will be continual proportionals;
which cannot happen in any line otherwise
divided.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.25'></a>25. If there be three continual proportionals, and
again, three other continual proportions, which
have the same middle term, their extremes will be
in reciprocal proportion. For let A. B. C and
D. B. E be continual proportionals, I say A. D ::
E. C shall be proportionals. For the proportion of
A to D is compounded of the proportions of A to B,
and of B to D; and the proportion of E to C is
compounded of those of E to B, that is, of B to D,
and of B to C, that is, of A to B. Wherefore, by
equality, A. D :: E. C are proportionals.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Comparison of arithmetical and geometrical proportion.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art13.26'></a>26. If any two unequal quantities be made extremes,
and there be interposed betwixt them any
number of means in geometrical proportion, and
the same number of means in arithmetical proportion,
the several means in geometrical proportion
will be less than the several means in arithmetical
proportion. For betwixt A the lesser, and E the
greater extreme, let there be interposed three
means, B, C, D, in geometrical proportion, and as
many more, F, G, H, in arithmetical proportion;
I say B will be less than F, C than G, and D than
H. For first, the difference between A and F is the
same with that between F and G, and with that
between G and H, by the definition of arithmetical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>proportion; and therefore, the difference of
the proportionals which stand next to one another,
to the difference of the extremes, is, when there is
but one mean, half their difference; when two, a
third part of it; when three, a quarter, &#38;c.; so that
in this example it is a quarter. But the difference
between D and E, by art. <a href='#art13.17'>17</a>, is more than a

quarter of the difference between
the extremes, because
the proportion is geometrical,
and therefore the difference
between A and D is less than
three quarters of the same
difference of the extremes. In
like manner, if the difference
between A and D be understood to be divided
into three equal parts, it may be proved, that the
difference between A and C is less than two quarters
of the difference of the extremes A and E.
And lastly, if the difference between A and C be
divided into two equal parts, that the difference
between A and B is less than a quarter of the
difference of the extremes A and E.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the consideration hereof, it is manifest,
that B, that is A together with something else
which is less than a fourth part of the difference of
the extremes A and E, is less than F, that is, than
the same A with something else which is equal to
the said fourth part. Also, that C, that is A with
something else which is less than two fourth parts
of the said difference, is less than G, that is, than
A together with the said two-fourths. And lastly,
that D, which exceeds A by less than three-fourths
of the said difference, is less than H, which exceeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the same A by three entire fourths of the
said difference. And in the same manner it would
be if there were four means, saving that instead
of fourths of the difference of the extremes we are
to take fifth parts; and so on.</p>

quantity be both added to it and subtracted from
it, and then another greater or less, the proportion
of the remainder to the aggregate, is greater
where the less quantity is added and substracted,

Let B be added to and substracted from
the quantity A; so that A - B be the remainder,
and A + B the aggregate; and again, let C, a
greater quantity than B, be added to and substracted
from the same A, so that A - C be the
remainder and A + C the aggregate; I say A - B.
A + B :: A - C. A + C will be an hyperlogism. For
A - B. A :: A - C. A is an hyperlogism of a greater
antecedent to the same consequent; and therefore
A - B. A + B :: A - C. A + C is a much greater hyperlogism,
being made of a greater antecedent to

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The definition end properties of a strait line.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.1'></a>1. Between two points given, the shortest line is
that, whose extreme points cannot be drawn farther
asunder without altering the quantity, that is,
without altering the proportion of that line to any
other line given. For the magnitude of a line is
computed by the greatest distance which may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>between its extreme points; so that any one line,
whether it be extended or bowed, has always one
and the same length, because it can have but one
greatest distance between its extreme points.</p>

<p class='c001'>And seeing the action, by which a strait line is
made crooked, or contrarily a crooked line is made
strait, is nothing but the bringing of its extreme
points nearer to one another, or the setting of
them further asunder, a <em>crooked line</em> may rightly
be defined to be <em>that, whose extreme points may
be understood to be drawn further asunder</em>;
and a <em>strait line</em> to be <em>that, whose extreme
points cannot be drawn further asunder; and
comparatively, a more crooked, to be that line
whose extreme points are nearer to one another
than those of the other, supposing both the lines
to be of equal length</em>. Now, howsoever a line
be bowed, it makes always a <em>sinus</em> or cavity, sometimes
on one side, sometimes on another; so that
the same crooked line may either have its whole
cavity on one side only, or it may have it part on
one side and part on the other side. Which
being well understood, it will be easy to understand
the following comparisons of strait and
crooked lines.</p>

<p class='c001'>First, if a strait and a crooked line have their
extreme points common, the crooked line is longer
than the strait line. For if the extreme points of
the crooked line be drawn out to their greatest
distance, it will be made a strait line, of which
that, which was a strait line from the beginning,
will be but a part; and therefore the strait line
was shorter than the crooked line, which had the
same extreme points. And for the same reason,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>if two crooked lines have their extreme points
common, and both of them have all their cavity on
one and the same side, the outermost of the two
will be the longest line.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, a strait line and a perpetually crooked
line cannot be coincident, no, not in the least
part. For if they should, then not only some
strait line would have its extreme points common
with some crooked line, but also they would, by
reason of their coincidence, be equal to one another;
which, as I have newly shown, cannot be.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, between two points given, there can
be understood but one strait line; because there
cannot be more than one least interval or length
between the same points. For if there may be
two, they will either be coincident, and so both of
them will be one strait line; or if they be not
coincident, then the application of one to the other
by extension will make the extended line have its
extreme points at greater distance than the other;
and consequently, it was crooked from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fourthly, from this last it follows, that two
strait lines cannot include a superficies. For if
they have both their extreme points common, they
are coincident; and if they have but one or neither
of them common, then at one or both ends the
extreme points will be disjoined, and include no
superficies, but leave all open and undetermined.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fifthly, every part of a strait line is a strait
line. For seeing every part of a strait line is the
least that can be drawn between its own extreme
points, if all the parts should not constitute a strait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>line, they would altogether be longer than the
whole line.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The definition and properties of a plane superficies.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.2'></a>2. A <em>plane</em> or <em>a plane superficies, is that which
is described by a strait line so moved, that all
the several points thereof describe several strait
lines</em>. A strait line, therefore, is necessarily all of
it in the same plane which it describes. Also the
strait lines, which are made by the points that
describe a plane, are all of them in the same plane.
Moreover, if any line whatsoever be moved in a
plane, the lines, which are described by it, are all
of them in the same plane.</p>

<p class='c001'>All other superficies, which are not plane, are
crooked, that is, are either concave or convex.
And the same comparisons, which were made of
strait and crooked lines, may also be made of plane
and crooked superficies.</p>

<p class='c001'>For, first, if a plane and crooked superficies be
terminated with the same lines, the crooked superficies
is greater than the plane superficies. For if
the lines, of which the crooked superficies consists,
be extended, they will be found to be longer
than those of which the plane superficies consists,
which cannot be extended, because they are strait.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, two superficies, whereof the one is
plane, and the other continually crooked, cannot
be coincident, no, not in the least part. For if they
were coincident, they would be equal; nay, the
same superficies would be both plane and crooked,
which is impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, within the same terminating lines
there can be no more than one plane superficies;
because there can be but one least superficies
within the same.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Fourthly, no number of plane superficies can
include a solid, unless more than two of them end
in a common vertex. For if two planes have both
the same terminating lines, they are coincident,
that is, they are but one superficies; and if their
terminating lines be not the same, they leave one
or more sides open.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fifthly, every part of a plane superficies is a
plane superficies. For seeing the whole plane
superficies is the least of all those, that have the
same terminating lines; and also every part of the
same superficies is the least of all those, that are
terminated with the same lines; if every part
should not constitute a plane superficies, all the
parts put together would not be equal to the
whole.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Several sorts of crooked lines.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.3'></a>3. Of straitness, whether it be in lines or in
superficies, there is but one kind; but of crookedness
there are many kinds; for of crooked magnitudes,
some are congruous, that is, are coincident
when they are applied to one other; others are
incongruous. Again, some are ὁμοιομερεῖς or uniform,
that is, have their parts, howsoever taken,
congruous to one another; others are ἀνομοιομερεῖς
or of several forms. Moreover, of such as are
crooked, some are continually crooked, others have
parts which are not crooked.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Definition and properties of a circular line.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.4'></a>4. If a strait line be moved in a plane, in such
manner, that while one end of it stands still, the
whole line be carried round about till it come
again into the same place from whence it was first
moved, it will describe a plane superficies, which
will be terminated every way by that crooked line,
which is made by that end of the strait line which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>was carried round. Now this superficies is called
a <span class='fss'>CIRCLE</span>; and of this circle, the unmoved point is
the <em>centre</em>; the crooked line which terminates it,
the <em>perimeter</em>; and every part of that crooked
line, a <em>circumference</em> or <em>arch</em>; the strait line, which
generated the <em>circle</em>, is the <em>semidiameter</em> or <em>radius</em>;
and any strait line, which passeth through
the centre and is terminated on both sides in the
circumference, is called the <em>diameter</em>. Moreover,
every point of the radius, which describes the
circle, describes in the same time its own perimeter,
terminating its own circle, which is said to
be <em>concentric</em> to all the other circles, because this
and all those have one common centre.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wherefore in every circle, all strait lines from
the centre to the circumference are equal. For
they are all coincident with the radius which
generates the circle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Also the diameter divides both the perimeter
and the circle itself into two equal parts. For if
those two parts be applied to one another, and the
semiperimeters be coincident, then, seeing they
have one common diameter, they will be equal;
and the semicircles will be equal also; for these
also will be coincident. But if the semiperimeters
be not coincident, then some one strait line, which
passes through the centre, which centre is in the
diameter, will be cut by them in two points.
Wherefore, seeing all the strait lines from the
centre to the circumference are equal, a part of
the same strait line will be equal to the whole;
which is impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the same reason the perimeter of a circle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>will be uniform, that is, any one part of it will be
coincident with any other equal part of the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The properties of a strait line taken in a plane.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.5'></a>5. From hence may be collected this property
of a strait line, namely, that it is all contained in
that plane which contains both its extreme points.
For seeing both its extreme points are in the
plane, that strait line, which describes the plane,
will pass through them both; and if one of them
be made a centre, and at the distance between
both a circumference be described, whose radius
is the strait line which describes the plane, that
circumference will pass through the other point.
Wherefore between the two propounded points,
there is one strait line, by the definition of a circle,
contained wholly in the propounded plane; and
therefore if another strait line might be drawn
between the same points, and yet not be contained
in the same plane, it would follow, that between
two points two strait lines may be drawn; which
has been demonstrated to be impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may also be collected, that if two planes cut
one another, their common section will be a strait
line. For the two extreme points of the intersection
are in both the intersecting planes; and
between those points a strait line may be drawn;
but a strait line between any two points is in the
same plane, in which the points are; and seeing
these are in both the planes, the strait line which
connects them will also be in both the same planes,
and therefore it is the common section of both.
And every other line, that can be drawn between
those points, will be either coincident with that
line, that is, it will be the same line; or it will not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>be coincident, and then it will be in neither, or
but in one of those planes.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a strait line may be understood to be
moved round about whilst one end thereof remains
fixed, as the centre; so in like manner it is easy to
understand, that a plane may be circumduced
about a strait line, whilst the strait line remains
still in one and the same place, as the <em>axis</em> of that
motion. Now from hence it is manifest, that any
three points are in some one plane. For as any
two points, if they be connected by a strait line,
are understood to be in the same plane in which
the strait line is; so, if that plane be circumduced
about the same strait line, it will in its revolution
take in any third point, howsoever it be situate;
and then the three points will be all in that plane;
and consequently the three strait lines which connect
those points, will also be in the same plane.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Definition of tangent lines.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.6'></a>6. Two lines are said to <em>touch</em> one another,
which being both drawn to one and the same
point, will not cut one another, though they be
produced, produced, I say, in the same manner in
which they were generated. And therefore if two
strait lines touch one another in any one point,
they will be contiguous through their whole length.
Also two lines continually crooked will do the
same, if they be congruous and be applied to one
another according to their congruity; otherwise,
if they be incongruously applied, they will, as all
other crooked lines, touch one another, where they
touch, but in one point only. Which is manifest
from this, that there can be no congruity between
a strait line and a line that is continually crooked;
for otherwise the same line might be both strait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>and crooked. Besides, when a strait line touches
a crooked line, if the strait line be never so little
moved about upon the point of contact, it will cut
the crooked line; for seeing it touches it but in
one point, if it incline any way, it will do more
than touch it; that is, it will either be congruous
to it, or it will cut it; but it cannot be congruous
to it; and therefore it will cut it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The definition of an angle, and the kinds thereof.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.7'></a>7. An angle, according to the most general
acceptation of the word, may be thus defined;
<em>when two lines, or many superficies, concur in one
sole point, and diverge every where else, the
quantity of that divergence is an</em> <span class='fss'>ANGLE</span>. And an
angle is of two sorts; for, first, it may be made
by the concurrence of lines, and then it is a <em>superficial
angle</em>; or by the concurrence of superficies,
and then it is called a <em>solid angle</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, from the two ways by which two lines
may diverge from one another, superficial angles
are divided into two kinds. For two strait lines,
which are applied to one another, and are contiguous
in their whole length, may be separated or
pulled open in such manner, that their concurrence
in one point will still remain; and this
separation or opening may be either by circular
motion, the centre whereof is their point of concurrence,
and the lines will still retain their straitness,
the quantity of which separation or divergence
is an <em>angle</em> simply so called; or they may be
separated by continual flexion or curvation in every
imaginable point; and the quantity of this separation
is that, which is called an <em>angle of contingence</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, of superficial angles simply so called,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>those, which are in a plane superficies, are plane;
and those, which are not plane, are denominated
from the superficies in which they are.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, those are <em>strait-lined angles</em>, which are
made by strait lines; as those which are made by
crooked lines are <em>crooked-lined</em>; and those which
are made both of strait and crooked lines, are
<em>mixed angles</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In concentric circles, arches of the same angle are to one another, as the whole circumferences are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.8'></a>8. Two arches intercepted between two radii of
concentric circles, have the same proportion to one
another, which their whole perimeters have to one
another. <a id='fig14.1'></a>For let the point A (in the <a href='#fig14.f1'>first figure</a>)
be the centre of the two circles B C D and E F G,
in which the radii A E B and A F C intercept the
arches B C and E F; I say the proportion of the
arch B C to the arch E F is the same with that of
the perimeter B C D to the perimeter E F G. For
if the radius A F C be understood to be moved
about the centre A with circular and uniform
motion, that is, with equal swiftness everywhere,
the point C will in a certain time describe the
perimeter B C D, and in a part of that time the
arch B C; and because the velocities are equal by
which both the arch and the whole perimeter are
described, the proportion of the magnitude of the
perimeter B C D to the magnitude of the arch BC
is determined by nothing but the difference of the
times in which the perimeter and the arch are
described. But both the perimeters are described
in one and the same time, and both the arches in
one and the same time; and therefore the proportions
of the perimeter B C D to the arch B C, and
of the perimeter E F G to the arch E F, are
both determined by the same cause. Wherefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>B C D. B C :: E F G. E F are proportionals (by the
<a href='#art13.6'>6th art.</a> of the last chapter), and by permutation
B C D. E F G :: B C. E F will also be proportionals;
which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The quantity of an angle, in what it consists.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.9'></a>9. Nothing is contributed towards the quantity
of an angle, neither by the length, nor by the
equality, nor by the inequality of the lines which
comprehend it. For the lines A B and A C comprehend
the same angle which is comprehended by
the lines A E and A F, or A B and A F. Nor is an
angle either increased or diminished by the absolute
quantity of the arch, which subtends the
same; for both the greater arch B C and the
lesser arch E F are subtended to the same angle.
But the quantity of an angle is estimated by the
quantity of the subtending arch compared with the
quantity of the whole perimeter. And therefore
the quantity of an angle simply so called may be
thus defined: <em>the quantity of an angle is an arch
or circumference of a circle, determined by its
proportion to the whole perimeter</em>. So that when
an arch is intercepted between two strait lines
drawn from the centre, look how great a portion
that arch is of the whole perimeter, so great is the
angle. From whence it may be understood, that
when the lines which contain an angle are strait
lines, the quantity of that angle may be taken at
any distance from the centre. But if one or both
of the containing lines be crooked, then the quantity
of the angle is to be taken in the least distance
from the centre, or from their concurrence; for
the least distance is to be considered as a strait
line, seeing no crooked line can be imagined so
little, but that there may be a less strait line. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>although the least strait line cannot be given,
because the least given line may still be divided,
yet we may come to a part so small, as is not at all
considerable; which we call a point. And this
point may be understood to be in a strait line
which touches a crooked line; for an angle is
generated by separating, by circular motion, one
strait line from another which touches it, as has
been said above in the <a href='#art14.7'>7th article</a>. Wherefore an
angle, which two crooked lines make, is the same
with that which is made by two strait lines which
touch them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The distinction of angles, simply so called.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig14.2'></a><a id='art14.10'></a>10. From hence it follows, that <em>vertical angles</em>,
such as are A B C, D B F in the <a href='#fig14.f2'>second figure</a>, are
equal to one another. For if, from the two semiperimeters
D A C, F D A, which are equal to one
another, the common arch D A be taken away, the
remaining arches A C, D F will be equal to one
another.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another distinction of angles is into <em>right</em> and
<em>oblique</em>. <em>A right angle is that, whose quantity is
the fourth part of the perimeter.</em> And the lines,
which make a right angle, are said to be <em>perpendicular</em>
to one another. Also, of oblique angles,
that which is greater than a right, is called an
<em>obtuse angle</em>; and that which is less, an <em>acute
angle</em>. From whence it follows, that all the angles
that can possibly be made at one and the same
point, together taken, are equal to four right
angles; because the quantities of them all put
together make the whole perimeter. Also, that
all the angles, which are made on one side of a
strait line, from any one point taken in the same,
are equal to two right angles; for if that point be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>made the centre, that strait line will be the diameter
of a circle, by whose circumference the
quantity of an angle is determined; and that diameter
will divide the perimeter into two equal
parts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of strait lines from the centre of a circle to a tangent of the same.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.11'></a>11. If a tangent be made the diameter of a
circle, whose centre is the point of contact, a
strait line drawn from the centre of the former
circle to the centre of the latter circle, will make
two angles with the tangent, that is, with the diameter
of the latter circle, equal to two right angles,
by the last article. And because, by the <a href='#art14.6'>6th article</a>,
the tangent has on both sides equal inclination to
the circle, each of them will be a right angle; as
also the semidiameter will be perpendicular to the
same tangent. Moreover, the semidiameter, inasmuch
as it is the semidiameter, is the least
strait line which can be drawn from the centre
to the tangent; and every other strait line, that
reaches the tangent, will pass out of the circle,
and will therefore be greater than the semidiameter.
In like manner, of all the strait lines,
which may be drawn from the centre to the tangent,
that is the greatest which makes the greatest
angle with the perpendicular; which will be manifest,
if about the same centre another circle be
described, whose semidiameter is a strait line
taken nearer to the perpendicular, and there be
drawn a perpendicular, that is, a tangent, to the
same.</p>

<p class='c001'>From whence it is also manifest, that if two
strait lines, which make equal angles on either
side of the perpendicular, be produced to the tangent,
they will be equal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The general definition of parallels; the properties of strait parallels.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span><a id='art14.12'></a>12. There is in Euclid a definition of strait-lined
parallels; but I do not find that parallels in
general are anywhere defined; and therefore for
an universal definition of them, I say that <em>any two
lines whatsoever, strait or crooked, as also any
two superficies, are</em> <span class='fss'>PARALLEL</span>; <em>when two equal
strait lines, wheresoever they fall upon them,
make always equal angles with each of them</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>From which definition it follows; first, that any
two strait lines, not inclined opposite ways, falling
upon two other strait lines, which are parallel, and
intercepting equal parts in both of them, are themselves
also equal and parallel. <a id='fig14.3'></a>As if A B and C D
(in the <a href='#fig14.f3'>third figure</a>), inclined both the same way,
fall upon the parallels A C and B D, and A C and
B D be equal, A B and C D will also be equal and
parallel. For the perpendiculars B E and D F
being drawn, the right angles E B D and F D H
will be equal. Wherefore, seeing E F and B D are
parallel, the angles E B A and F D C will be equal.
Now if D C be not equal to B A, let any other
strait line equal to B A be drawn from the point D;
which, seeing it cannot fall upon the point C, let
it fall upon G. Wherefore A G will be either
greater or less than B D; and therefore the angles
E B A and F D C are not equal, as was supposed.
Wherefore A B and C D are equal; which is the
first.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, because they make equal angles with the
perpendiculars B E and D F; therefore the angle
C D H will be equal to the angle A B D, and, by
the definition of parallels, A B and C D will be
parallel; which is the second.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>That plane, which is included both ways
within parallel lines, is called a</em> <span class='fss'>PARALLELOGRAM</span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span><a id='cor14.12.1'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>I.</span> From this last it follows, that the
angles A B D and C D H are equal, that is, that
a strait line, as B H, falling upon two parallels, as
A B and C D, makes the internal angle A B D
equal to the external and opposite angle C D H.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig14.4'></a><a id='cor14.12.2'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>II.</span> And from hence again it follows, that
a strait line falling upon two parallels, makes the
alternate angles equal, that is, the angle A G F, in
the <a href='#fig14.f4'>fourth figure</a>, equal to the angle G F D. For
seeing G F D is equal to the external opposite
angle E G B, it will be also equal to its vertical
angle A G F, which is alternate to G F D.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor14.12.3'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>III.</span> That the internal angles on the
same side of the line F G are equal to two right
angles. For the angles at F, namely, G F C and
G F D, are equal to two right angles. But G F D
is equal to its alternate angle A G F. Wherefore
both the angles G F C and A G F, which are internal
on the same side of the line F G, are equal
to two right angles.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor14.12.4'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>IV.</span> That the three angles of a strait-lined
plain triangle are equal to two right angles;
and any side being produced, the external angle
will be equal to the two opposite internal angles.
<a id='fig14.5'></a>For if there be drawn by the vertex of the plain
triangle A B C (<a href='#fig14.f5'>fig. 5</a>) a parallel to any of the
sides, as to A B, the angles A and B will be equal
to their alternate angles E and F, and the angle C
is common. But, by the <a href='#art14.10'>10th article</a>, the three
angles E, C and F, are equal to two right angles;
and therefore the three angles of the triangle are
equal to the same; which is the first. Again,
the two angles B and D are equal to two right
angles, by the 10th article. Wherefore taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>away B, there will remain the angles A and C,
equal to the angle D; which is the second.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor14.12.5'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>V.</span> If the angles A and B be equal, the
sides A C and C B will also be equal, because A B
and E F are parallel; and, on the contrary, if the
sides A C and C B be equal, the angles A and B
will also be equal. For if they be not equal, let
the angles B and G be equal. Wherefore, seeing
G B and E F are parallels, and the angles G and B
equal, the sides G C and C B will also be equal;
and because C B and A C are equal by supposition,
C G and C A will also be equal; which cannot
be, by the <a href='#art14.11'>11th article</a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor14.12.6'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>VI.</span> From hence it is manifest, that if
two radii of a circle be connected by a strait line,
the angles they make with that connecting line
will be equal to one another; and if there be
added that segment of the circle, which is subtended
by the same line which connects the radii,
then the angles, which those radii make with the
circumference, will also be equal to one another.
For a strait line, which subtends any arch, makes
equal angles with the same; because, if the arch
and the subtense be divided in the middle, the two
halves of the segment will be congruous to one
another, by reason of the uniformity both of the
circumference of the circle, and of the strait line.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The circumferences of circles are to one another as their diameters are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.13'></a>13. Perimeters of circles are to one another, as
their semidiameters are. For let there be any two
circles, as, in the first figure, B C D the greater,
and E F G the lesser, having their common centre
at A; and let their semidiameters be A C and A E.
I say, A C has the same proportion to A E, which
the perimeter B C D has to the perimeter E F G.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>For the magnitude of the semidiameters A C and
A E is determined by the distance of the points
C and E from the centre A; and the same distances
are acquired by the uniform motion of a
point from A to C, in such manner, that in equal
times the distances acquired be equal. But the
perimeters B C D and E F G are also determined
by the same distances of the points C and E from
the centre A; and therefore the perimeters B C D
and E F G, as well as the semidiameters A C and
A E, have their magnitudes determined by the
same cause, which cause makes, in equal times,
equal spaces. Wherefore, by the 13th chapter and <a href='#art13.6'>6th article</a>, the perimeters of circles and their
semidiameters are proportionals; which was to be
proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In triangles strait lines parallel to the bases are to one another, as the parts of the sides which they cut off from the vertex.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.14'></a>14. If two strait lines, which constitute an angle,
be cut by strait-lined parallels, the intercepted parallels
will be to one another, as the parts which
they cut off from the vertex. <a id='fig14.6'></a>Let the strait lines
A B and A C, in the <a href='#fig14.f6'>6th figure</a>, make an angle at
A, and be cut by the two strait-lined parallels B C
and D E, so that the parts cut off from the vertex
in either of those lines, as in A B, may be A B
and A D. I say, the parallels B C and D E are to
one another, as the parts A B and A D. For let
A B be divided into any number of equal parts, as
into A F, F D, D B; and by the points F and D,
let F G and D E be drawn parallel to the base B C,
and cut A C in G and E; and again, by the points
G and E, let other strait lines be drawn parallel
to A B, and cut B C in H and I. If now the point
A be understood to be moved uniformly over A B,
and in the same time B be moved to C, and all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>points F, D, and B be moved uniformly and with
equal swiftness over F G, D E, and B C; then shall
B pass over B H, equal to F G, in the same time that
A passes over A F; and A F and F G will be to one
another, as their velocities are; and when A is in
F, D will be in K; when A is in D, D will be in E;
and in what manner the point A passes by the
points F, D, and B, in the same manner the point
B will pass by the points H, I, and C; and the
strait lines F G, D K, K E, B H, H I, and I C, are
equal, by reason of their parallelism; and therefore,
as the velocity in A B is to the velocity in B C, so
is A D to D E; but as the velocity in A B is to
the velocity in B C, so is A B to B C; that is to say,
all the parallels will be severally to all the parts
cut off from the vertex, as A F is to F G. Wherefore,
A F. G F :: A D. D E :: A B. B C are proportionals.</p>

<p class='c001'>The subtenses of equal angles in different circles,
as the strait lines B C and F E (in <a href='#fig14.f1'>fig. 1</a>), are to
one another as the arches which they subtend.
For (by <a href='#art14.8'>art. 8</a>) the arches of equal angles are to
one another as their perimeters are; and (by <a href='#art14.13'>art. 13</a>)
the perimeters as their semidiameters; but the
subtenses B C and F E are parallel to one another
by reason of the equality of the angles which they
make with the semidiameters; and therefore the
same subtenses, by the last precedent article, will
be proportional to the semidiameters, that is, to
the perimeters, that is, to the arches which they
subtend.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>By what fraction of a strait line the circumference of a circle is made.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig14.7'></a><a id='art14.15'></a>15. If in a circle any number of equal subtenses
be placed immediately after one another, and strait
lines be drawn from the extreme point of the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>subtense to the extreme points of all the rest, the
first subtense being produced will make with the
second subtense an external angle double to that,
which is made by the same first subtense, and a
tangent to the circle touching it in the extreme
points thereof; and if a strait line which subtends
two of those arches be produced, it will make an
external angle with the third subtense, triple to
the angle which is made by the tangent with the
first subtense; and so continually. For with the
radius A B (in <a href='#fig14.f7'>fig. 7</a>) let a circle be described, and
in it let any number of equal subtenses, B C, C D,
and D E, be placed; also let B D and B E be drawn;
and by producing B C, B D and B E to any distance
in G, H and I, let them make angles with
the subtenses which succeed one another, namely,
the external angles G C D, and H D E. Lastly, let
the tangent K B be drawn, making with the first
subtense the angle K B C. I say the angle G C D
is double to the angle K B C, and the angle H D E
triple to the same angle K B C. For if A C be
drawn cutting B D in M, and from the point C
there be drawn L C perpendicular to the same A C,
then C L and M D will be parallel, by reason of
the right angles at C and M; and therefore the
alterne angles L C D and B D C will be equal: as
also the angles B D C and C B D will be equal,
because of the equality of the strait lines B C and
C D. Wherefore the angle G C D is double to
either of the angles C B D or C D B; and therefore
also the angle G C D is double to the angle
L C D, that is, to the angle K B C. Again, C D is
parallel to B E, by reason of the equality of the
angles C B E and D E B, and of the strait lines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>C B and D E; and therefore the angles G C D and
G B E are equal; and consequently G B E, as also
D E B is double to the angle K B C. But the external
angle H D E is equal to the two internal
D E B and D B E; and therefore the angle H D E
is triple to the angle K B C, &#38;c.; which was to be
proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor14.15.1'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>I.</span> From hence it is manifest, that the
angles K B C and C B D, as also, that all the angles
that are comprehended by two strait lines meeting
in the circumference of a circle and insisting upon
equal arches, are equal to one another.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor14.15.2'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>II.</span> If the tangent B K be moved in the
circumference with uniform motion about the
centre B, it will in equal times cut off equal arches;
and will pass over the whole perimeter in the same
time in which itself describes a semiperimeter about
the centre B.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor14.15.3'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>III.</span> From hence also we may understand,
what it is that determines the bending or
curvation of a strait line into the circumference of
a circle; namely, that it is fraction continually increasing
in the same manner, as numbers, from
one upwards, increase by the continual addition of
unity. For the indefinite strait line K B being
broken in B according to any angle, as that of
K B C, and again in C according to a double angle,
and in D according to an angle which is triple,
and in E according to an angle which is quadruple
to the first angle, and so continually, there will
be described a figure which will indeed be rectilineal,
if the broken parts be considered as having
magnitude; but if they be understood to be the
least that can be, that is, as so many points, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the figure described will not be rectilineal, but a
circle, whose circumference will be the broken
line.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor14.15.4'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>IV.</span> From what has been said in this present
article, it may also be demonstrated, that an
angle in the centre is double to an angle in the
circumference of the same circle, if the intercepted
arches be equal. For seeing that strait line, by
whose motion an angle is determined, passes over
equal arches in equal times, as well from the centre
as from the circumference; and while that, which
is from the circumference, is passing over half its
own perimeter, it passes in the same time over the
whole perimeter of that which is from the centre,
the arches, which it cuts off in the perimeter whose
centre is A, will be double to those, which it makes
in its own semiperimeter, whose centre is B. But
in equal circles, as arches are to one another, so
also are angles.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may also be demonstrated, that the external
angle made by a subtense produced and the next
equal subtense is equal to an angle from the centre
insisting upon the same arch; as in the last diagram,
the angle G C D is equal to the angle C A D;
for the external angle G C D is double to the angle
C B D; and the angle C A D insisting upon the
same arch C D is also double to the same angle
C B D or K B C.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>That an angle of contingence is quantity, but of a different kind from that of an angle simply so called; and that it can neither add nor take away anything from the same.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.16'></a>16. An angle of contingence, if it be compared
with an angle simply so called, how little soever,
has such proportion to it as a point has to a line;
that is, no proportion at all, nor any quantity. For
first, an angle of contingence is made by continual
flexion; so that in the generation of it there is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>circular motion at all, in which consists the nature
of an angle simply so called; and therefore it cannot
be compared with it according to quantity.
Secondly, seeing the external angle made by a
subtense produced and the next subtense is equal
to an angle from the centre insisting upon the
same arch, as in the last figure the angle G C D is
equal to the angle C A D, the angle of contingence
will be equal to that angle from the centre, which
is made by A B and the same A B; for no part of
a tangent can subtend any arch; but as the point
of contact is to be taken for the subtense, so the
angle of contingence is to be accounted for the
external angle, and equal to that angle whose arch
is the same point B.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, seeing an angle in general is defined to be
the opening or divergence of two lines, which concur
in one sole point; and seeing one opening is
greater than another, it cannot be denied, but that
by the very generation of it, an angle of contingence
is quantity; for wheresoever there is greater
and less, there is also quantity; but this quantity
consists in greater and less flexion; for how much
the greater a circle is, so much the nearer comes
the circumference of it to the nature of a strait
line; for the circumference of a circle being made
by the curvation of a strait line, the less that strait
line is, the greater is the curvation; and therefore,
when one strait line is a tangent to many circles,
the angle of contingence, which it makes with a
less circle, is greater than that which it makes
with a greater circle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing therefore is added to or taken from an
angle simply so called, by the addition to it or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>taking from it of never so many angles of contingence.
And as an angle of one sort can never be
equal to an angle of the other sort, so they cannot
be either greater or less than one another.</p>

<p class='c001'>From whence it follows, that an angle of a segment,
that is, the angle, which any strait line
makes with any arch, is equal to the angle which
is made by the same strait line, and another which
touches the circle in the point of their concurrence;
as in the last figure, the angle which is
made between G B and B K is equal to that which
is made between G B and the arch B C.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>That the inclination of planes is angle simply so called.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.17'></a>17. An angle, which is made by two planes, is
commonly called the inclination of those planes;
and because planes have equal inclination in all
their parts, instead of their inclination an angle is
taken, which is made by two strait lines, one of
which is in one, the other in the other of those
planes, but both perpendicular to the common
section.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A solid angle what it is.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.18'></a>18. A solid angle may be conceived two ways.
First, for the aggregate of all the angles, which are
made by the motion of a strait line, while one extreme
point thereof remaining fixed, it is carried
about any plain figure, in which the fixed point of
the strait line is not contained. And in this sense,
it seems to be understood by Euclid. Now it is
manifest, that the quantity of a solid angle so conceived
is no other, than the aggregate of all the
angles in a superficies so described, that is, in the
superficies of a pyramidal solid. Secondly, when
a pyramis or cone has its vertex in the centre of a
sphere, a solid angle may be understood to be the
proportion of a spherical superficies subtending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>that vertex to the whole superficies of the sphere.
In which sense, solid angles are to one another as
the spherical bases of solids, which have their vertex
in the centre of the same sphere.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is the nature of asymptotes.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.19'></a>19. All the ways, by which two lines respect one
another, or all the variety of their position, may
be comprehended under four kinds; for any two
lines whatsoever are either parallels, or being produced,
if need be, or moved one of them to the
other parallelly to itself, they make an angle; or
else, by the like production and motion, they touch
one another; or lastly, they are <em>asymptotes</em>. The
nature of parallels, angles, and tangents, has been
already declared. It remains that I speak briefly
of the nature of asymptotes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Asymptosy depends upon this, that quantity is
infinitely divisible. And from hence it follows, that
any line being given, and a body supposed to be
moved from one extreme thereof towards the other,
it is possible, by taking degrees of velocity always
less and less, in such proportion as the parts of the
line are made less by continual division, that the
same body may be always moved forwards in that
line, and yet never reach the end of it. <a id='fig14.8'></a>For it is
manifest, that if any strait line, as A F, (in the <a href='#fig14.f8'>8th figure</a>)
be cut anywhere in B, and again B F be cut
in C, and C F in D, and D F in E, and so eternally,
and there be drawn from the point F, the strait
line F F at any angle A F F; and lastly, if the strait
lines A F, B F, C F, D F, E F, &#38;c., having the same
proportion to one another with the segments of
the line A F, be set in order and parallel to the
same A F, the crooked line A B C D E, and the
strait line F F, will be <em>asymptotes</em>, that is, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>will always come nearer and nearer together, but
never touch one another. Now, because any line
may be cut eternally according to the proportions
which the segments have to one another, therefore
the divers kinds of asymptotes are infinite in number,
and not necessary to be further spoken of in
this place. In the nature of asymptotes in general
there is no more, than that they come still nearer
and nearer, but never touch. But in special in the
asymptosy of hyperbolic lines, it is understood
they should approach to a distance less than any
given quantity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Situation, by what it is determined.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art14.20'></a>20. <span class='sc'>Situation</span> <em>is the relation of one place to
another</em>; and where there are many places, their
situation is determined by four things; by <em>their
distances from one another</em>; by <em>several distances
from a place assigned</em>; by <em>the order of strait
lines drawn from a place assigned to the places
of them all</em>; and by <em>the angles which are made
by the lines so drawn</em>. For if their distances,
order, and angles, be given, that is, be certainly
known, their several places will also be so certainly
known, as that they can be no other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is like situation; what is figure; and what are like figures.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig14.9'></a><a id='art14.21'></a>21. Points, how many soever they be, have <em>like
situation</em> with an equal number of other points,
when all the strait lines, that are drawn from some
one point to all these, have severally the same
proportion to those, that are drawn in the same
order and at equal angles from some one point to
all those. For let there be any number of points
as A, B, and C, (in the <a href='#fig14.f9'>9th figure</a>) to which from
some one point D let the strait lines D A, D B, and
D C be drawn; and let there be an equal number
of other points, as E, F, and G, and from some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>point H let the strait lines H E, H F, and H G be
drawn, so that the angles A D B and B D C be
severally and in the same order equal to the angles
E H F and F H G, and the strait lines D A, D B,
and D C proportional to the strait lines H E, H F,
and H G; I say, the three points A, B, and C, have
like situation with the three points E, F, and G, or
are placed alike. For if H E be understood to be
laid upon D A, so that the point H be in D, the
point F will be in the strait line D B, by reason of
the equality of the angles A D B and E H F; and
the point G will be in the strait line D C, by reason
of the equality of the angles B D C and F H G;
and the strait lines A B and E F, as also B C and
F G, will be parallel, because A D. E H :: B D.
F H :: C D. G H are proportionals by construction;
and therefore the distances between the points A
and B, and the points B and C, will be proportional
to the distances between the points E and F,
and the points F and G. Wherefore, in the situation
of the points A, B, and C, and the situation
of the points E, F and G, the angles in the same
order are equal; so that their situations differ in
nothing but the inequality of their distances from
one another, and of their distances from the points
D and H. Now, in both the orders of points, those
inequalities are equal; for A B. B C :: E F. F G,
which are their distances from one another, as
also D A. D B. D C :: H E. H F. H G, which are
their distances from the assumed points D and
H, are proportionals. Their difference, therefore,
consists solely in the magnitude of their distances.
But, by the definition of <em>like</em>, (chapter <span class='fss'>I.</span> <a href='#art1.2'>article 2</a>)
those things, which differ only in magnitude, are
like. Wherefore the points A, B, and C, have to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>one another like situation with the points E, F,
and G, or are placed alike; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Figure</span> <em>is quantity, determined by the situation
or placing of all its extreme points</em>. Now I call
those points extreme, which are contiguous to the
place which is without the figure. In lines therefore
and superficies, all points may be called extreme;
but in solids only those which are in the
superficies that includes them.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Like figures</em> are those, whose extreme points in
one of them are all placed like all the extreme
points in the other; for such figures differ in
nothing but magnitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>And like figures are <em>alike placed</em>, when in both
of them the homologal strait lines, that is, the strait
lines which connect the points which answer one
another, are parallel, and have their proportional
sides inclined the same way.</p>

<p class='c001'>And seeing every strait line is like every other
strait line, and every plane like every other plane,
when nothing but planeness is considered; if the
lines, which include planes, or the superficies,
which include solids, have their proportions known,
it will not be hard to know whether any figure
be like or unlike to another propounded figure.</p>

<p class='c001'>And thus much concerning the <em>first grounds of
philosophy</em>. The next place belongs to <em>geometry</em>;
in which the quantities of figures are sought out
from the proportions of lines and angles. Wherefore
it is necessary for him, that would study geometry,
to know first what is the nature of quantity,
proportion, angle and figure. Having therefore
explained these in the three last chapters, I
thought fit to add them to this part; and so pass
to the next.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Repetition of some principles of the doctrine of motion formerly set down.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.1'></a>1. The next things in order to be treated of are
<span class='fss'>MOTION</span> and <span class='fss'>MAGNITUDE</span>, which are the most
common accidents of all bodies. This place therefore
most properly belongs to the elements of
geometry. But because this part of philosophy,
having been improved by the best wits of all ages,
has afforded greater plenty of matter than can well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>be thrust together within the narrow limits of this
discourse, I thought fit to admonish the reader,
that before he proceed further, he take into his
hands the works of Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius,
and other as well ancient as modern writers.
For to what end is it, to do over again that which
is already done? The little therefore that I shall
say concerning geometry in some of the following
chapters, shall be such only as is new, and conducing
to natural philosophy.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have already delivered some of the principles
of this doctrine in the eighth and ninth chapters;
which I shall briefly put together here, that the
reader in going on may have their light nearer at
hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>First, therefore, in chap. <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> <a href='#art8.10'>art. 10</a>, <em>motion</em> is
defined to be <em>the continual privation of one place,
and acquisition of another</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, it is there shown, that <em>whatsoever is
moved is moved in time</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, in the same chapter, <a href='#art8.11'>art. 11</a>, I have
defined <em>rest to be when a body remains for some
time in one place</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fourthly, it is there shown, that <em>whatsoever is
moved is not in any determined place</em>; as also
that the same <em>has been moved, is still moved, and
will yet be moved</em>; so that in every part of that
space, in which motion is made, we may consider
three times, namely, the <em>past</em>, the <em>present</em>, and
<em>future time</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fifthly, in <a href='#art8.15'>art. 15</a> of the same chapter, I have
defined <em>velocity</em> or <em>swiftness to be motion considered
as power, namely, that power by which a
body moved may in a certain time transmit a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>certain length</em>; which also may more briefly be
enunciated thus, <em>velocity is the quantity of motion
determined by time and line</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sixthly, in the same chapter, art. <a href='#art8.16'>16</a>, I have
shown that <em>motion is the measure of time</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Seventhly, in the same chapter, <a href='#art8.17'>art. 17</a>, I have
defined motions to be equally swift, when in equal
times equal lengths are transmitted by them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Eighthly, in <a href='#art8.18'>art. 18</a> of the same chapter, <em>motions</em>
are defined to be <em>equal, when the swiftness of one
moved body, computed in every part of its magnitude,
is equal to the swiftness of another, computed
also in every part of its magnitude</em>. From
whence it is to be noted, that <em>motions equal to
one another, and motions equally swift</em>, do not
signify the same thing; for when two horses draw
abreast, the motion of both is greater than the
motion of either of them singly; but the swiftness
of both together is but equal to that of either.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ninthly, in <a href='#art8.19'>art. 19</a> of the same chapter, I have
shown, that <em>whatsoever is at rest will always be
at rest, unless there be some other body besides
it, which by getting into its place suffers it no
longer to remain at rest</em>. And that <em>whatsoever is
moved, will always be moved, unless there be some
other body besides it, which hinders its motion</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tenthly, in chap. <span class='fss'>IX.</span> <a href='#art9.7'>art. 7</a>, I have demonstrated,
that <em>when any body is moved which was formerly
at rest, the immediate efficient cause of that motion
is in some other moved and contiguous body</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.1.11'></a>Eleventhly, I have shown in the same place, that
<em>whatsoever is moved, will always be moved in the
same way, and with the same swiftness, if it be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>not hindered by some other moved and contiguous
body</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Other principles<br>added to them.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.2'></a>2. To which principles I shall here add those
that follow. <a id='art15.2.1'></a>First, I define <span class='fss'>ENDEAVOUR</span> <em>to be
motion made in less space and time than can be
given</em>; that is, <em>less than can be determined or
assigned by exposition or number</em>; that is, <em>motion
made through the length of a point, and in an
instant or point of time</em>. For the explaining of
which definition it must be remembered, that by a
point is not to be understood that which has no
quantity, or which cannot by any means be
divided; for there is no such thing in nature;
but that, whose quantity is not at all considered,
that is, whereof neither quantity nor any part is
computed in demonstration; so that a point is not
to be taken for an indivisible, but for an undivided
thing; as also an instant is to be taken for an
undivided, and not for an indivisible time.</p>

<p class='c001'>In like manner, endeavour is to be conceived as
motion; but so as that neither the quantity of the
time in which, nor of the line in which it is made,
may in demonstration be at all brought into comparison
with the quantity of that time, or of that
line of which it is a part. And yet, as a point may
be compared with a point, so one endeavour may
be compared with another endeavour, and one
may be found to be greater or less than another.
For if the vertical points of two angles be compared,
they will be equal or unequal in the same
proportion which the angles themselves have to
one another. Or if a strait line cut many circumferences
of concentric circles, the inequality of the
points of intersection will be in the same proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>which the perimeters have to one another.
And in the same manner, if two motions begin
and end both together, their endeavours will be
equal or unequal, according to the proportion of
their velocities; as we see a bullet of lead descend
with greater endeavour than a ball of wool.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.2.2'></a>Secondly, I define <span class='fss'>IMPETUS</span>, <em>or quickness of
motion, to be the swiftness or velocity of the body
moved, but considered in the several points of
that time in which it is moved. In which sense</em>
impetus <em>is nothing else but the quantity or velocity
of endeavour. But considered with the whole
time, it is the whole velocity of the body moved
taken together throughout all the time, and equal
to the product of a line representing the time,
multiplied into a line representing the arithmetically
mean</em> impetus <em>or quickness</em>. Which
arithmetical mean, what it is, is defined in the <a href='#art13.29'>29th article</a>
of chapter <span class='fss'>XIII.</span></p>

<p class='c001'>And because in equal times the ways that are
passed are as the velocities, and the <em>impetus</em> is the
velocity they go withal, reckoned in all the several
points of the times, it followeth that during any
time whatsoever, howsoever the <em>impetus</em> be increased
or decreased, the length of the way passed
over shall be increased or decreased in the same
proportion; and the same line shall represent
both the way of the body moved, and the several
<em>impetus</em> or degrees of swiftness wherewith the way
is passed over.</p>

<p class='c001'>And if the body moved be not a point, but a
strait line moved so as that every point thereof
make a several strait line, the plane described by
its motion, whether uniform, accelerated, or retarded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>shall be greater or less, the time being the
same, in the same proportion with that of the
<em>impetus</em> reckoned in one motion to the <em>impetus</em>
reckoned in the other. For the reason is the same
in parallelograms and their sides.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the same cause also, if the body moved be a
plane, the solid described shall be still greater or
less in the proportions of the several <em>impetus</em> or
quicknesses reckoned through one line, to the
several <em>impetus</em> reckoned through another.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig17.1'></a>This understood, let A B C D, (in <a href='#fig17.f1'>figure 1</a>, chap.
<span class='fss'>XVII.</span>) be a parallelogram; in which suppose the
side A B to be moved parallelly to the opposite side
C D, decreasing all the way till it vanish in the
point C, and so describing the figure A B E F C;
the point B, as A B decreaseth, will therefore describe
the line B E F C; and suppose the time of
this motion designed by the line C D; and in the
same time C D, suppose the side A C to be moved
parallel and uniformly to B D. From the point O
taken at adventure in the line C D, draw O R parallel
to B D, cutting the line B E F C in E, and
the side A B in R. And again, from the point Q
taken also at adventure in the line C D, draw Q S
parallel to B D, cutting the line B E F C in F, and
the side A B in S; and draw E G and F H parallel
to C D, cutting A C in G and H. Lastly, suppose
the same construction done in all the points possible
of the line B E F C. I say, that as the proportions
of the swiftness wherewith Q F, O E, D B,
and all the rest supposed to be drawn parallel to
D B and terminated in the line B E F C, are to
the proportions of their several times designed by
the several parallels H F, G E, A B, and all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>rest supposed to be drawn parallel to the line of
time C D and terminated in the line B E F C, the
aggregate to the aggregate, so is the area or plane
D B E F C to the area or plane A C F E B. For
as A B decreasing continually by the line B E F C
vanisheth in the time C D into the point C, so in
the same time the line D C continually decreasing
vanisheth by the same line C F E B into the point
B; and the point D describeth in that decreasing
motion the line D B equal to the line A C described
by the point A in the decreasing motion of A B;
and their swiftnesses are therefore equal. Again,
because in the time G E the point O describeth the
line OE, and in the same time the point S describeth
the line S E, the line O E shall be to the
line SE, as the swiftness wherewith OE is described
to the swiftness wherewith SE is described.
In like manner, because in the same time H F the
point Q describeth the line Q F, and the point R
the line R F, it shall be as the swiftness by which
Q F is described to the swiftness by which R F is
described, so the line itself Q F to the line itself
R F; and so in all the lines that can possibly be
drawn parallel to B D in the points where they
cut the line B E F C. But all the parallels to B D,
as S E, R F, A C, and the rest that can possibly be
drawn from the line A B to the line B E F C, make
the area of the plane A B E F C; and all the parallels
to the same B D, as Q F, O E, D B and the
rest drawn to the points where they cut the same
line B E F C, make the area of the plane B E F C D.
As therefore the aggregate of the swiftnesses
wherewith the plane B E F C D is described, is
to the aggregate of the swiftnesses wherewith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the plane A C F E B is described, so is the plane
itself B E F C D to the plane itself A C F E B. But
the aggregate of the times represented by the parallels
A B, G E, H F and the rest, maketh also
the area A C F E B. And therefore, as the aggregate
of all the lines Q F, O E, D B and all the rest
of the lines parallel to B D and terminated in the
line B E F C, is to the aggregate of all the lines
H F, G E, A B and all the rest of the lines parallel
to C D and terminated in the same line
B E F C; that is, as the aggregate of the lines
of swiftness to the aggregate of the lines of time,
or as the whole swiftness in the parallels to D B to
the whole time in the parallels to C D, so is the
plane B E F C D to the plane A C F E B. And the
proportions of Q F to F H, and of O E to E G, and
of D B to B A, and so of all the rest taken together,
are the proportions of the plane D B E F C
to the plane A B E F C. But the lines Q F, O E,
D B and the rest are the lines that design the swiftness;
and the lines H F, G E, A B and the rest are
the lines that design the times of the motions;
and therefore the proportion of the plane D B E F C
to the plane A B E F C is the proportion of all the
velocities taken together to all the times taken
together. Wherefore, as the proportions of the
swiftnesses, &#38;c.; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same holds also in the diminution of the
circles, whereof the lines of time are the semidiameters,
as may easily be conceived by imagining
the whole plane A B C D turned round upon the
axis B D; for the line B E F C will be everywhere
in the superficies so made, and the lines H F, G E,
A B, which are here parallelograms, will be there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>cylinders, the diameters of whose bases are the
lines H F, G E, A B, &#38;c. and the altitude a point,
that is to say, a quantity less than any quantity
that can possibly be named; and the lines Q F, O E,
D B, &#38;c. small solids whose lengths and breadths
are less than any quantity that can be named.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this is to be noted, that unless the proportion
of the sum of the swiftnesses to the proportion
of the sum of the times be determined, the proportion
of the figure D B E F C to the figure A B E F C
cannot be determined.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.2.3'></a>Thirdly, I define <span class='fss'>RESISTANCE</span> <em>to be the endeavour
of one moved body either wholly or in part
contrary to the endeavour of another moved body,
which toucheth the same</em>. I say, wholly contrary,
when the endeavour of two bodies proceeds in the
same strait line from the opposite extremes, and
contrary in part, when two bodies have their endeavour
in two lines, which, proceeding from the
extreme points of a strait line, meet without the
same.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.2.4'></a>Fourthly, that I may define what it is to <span class='fss'>PRESS</span>,
I say, that <em>of two moved bodies one presses the
other, when with its endeavour it makes either all
or part of the other body to go out of its place</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.2.5'></a>Fifthly, <em>a body, which is pressed and not
wholly removed, is said to</em> <span class='fss'>RESTORE</span> <em>itself, when,
the pressing body being taken away, the parts
which were moved do, by reason of the internal
constitution of the pressed body, return every one
into its own place</em>. And this we may observe in
springs, in blown bladders, and in many other
bodies, whose parts yield more or less to the endeavour
which the pressing body makes at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>first arrival; but afterwards, when the pressing
body is removed, they do, by some force within
them, <em>restore</em> themselves, and give their whole
body the same figure it had before.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.2.6'></a>Sixthly, I define <span class='fss'>FORCE</span> <em>to be the</em> impetus <em>or
quickness of motion multiplied either into itself,
or into the magnitude of the movent, by means
whereof the said movent works more or less upon
the body that resists it</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Certain theorems concerning the nature of motion.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.3'></a>3. Having premised thus much, I shall now
demonstrate, first, that if a point moved come to
touch another point which is at rest, how little
soever the impetus or quickness of its motion be,
it shall move that other point. For if by that
impetus it do not at all move it out of its place,
neither shall it move it with double the same
impetus. For nothing doubled is still nothing;
and for the same reason it shall never move it with
that impetus, how many times soever it be multiplied,
because nothing, however it be multiplied,
will for ever be nothing. Wherefore, when a
point is at rest, if it do not yield to the least
impetus, it will yield to none; and consequently
it will be impossible that that, which is at rest,
should ever be moved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, that when a point moved, how little
soever the impetus thereof be, falls upon a point of
any body at rest, how hard soever that body be, it
will at the first touch make it yield a little. For if
it do not yield to the impetus which is in that
point, neither will it yield to the impetus of never
so many points, which have all their impetus severally
equal to the impetus of that point. For seeing
all those points together work equally, if any one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>of them have no effect, the aggregate of them all
together shall have no effect as many times told as
there are points in the whole body, that is, still no
effect at all; and by consequent there would be
some bodies so hard that it would be impossible to
break them; that is, a finite hardness, or a finite
force, would not yield to that which is infinite;
which is absurd.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. It is therefore manifest, that rest does
nothing at all, nor is of any efficacy; and that
nothing but motion gives motion to such things
as be at rest, and takes it from things moved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, that cessation in the movent does not
cause cessation in that which was moved by it.
For (by number 11 of <a href='#art15.1.11'>art. 1</a> of this chapter) whatsoever
is moved perseveres in the same way and
with the same swiftness, as long as it is not hindered
by something that is moved against it. Now
it is manifest, that cessation is not contrary motion;
and therefore it follows that the standing
still of the movent does not make it necessary that
the thing moved should also stand still.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. They are therefore deceived, that reckon
the taking away of the impediment or resistance
for one of the causes of motion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Divers considerations of motions.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.4'></a>4. Motion is brought into account for divers
respects; first, as in a body <em>undivided</em>, that is,
considered as a point; or, as in a <em>divided</em> body.
In an undivided body, when we suppose the way,
by which the motion is made, to be a line; and in
a divided body, when we compute the motion of
the several parts of that body, as of parts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, from the diversity of the regulation
of motion, it is in body, considered as undivided.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>sometimes <em>uniform</em> and sometimes <em>multiform</em>. <em>Uniform</em>
is that by which equal lines are always
transmitted in equal times; and <em>multiform</em>, when
in one time more, in another time less space is
transmitted. Again, of multiform motions, there
are some in which the degrees of acceleration and
retardation proceed in the same proportions, which
the spaces transmitted have, whether duplicate, or
triplicate, or by whatsoever number multiplied;
and others in which it is otherwise.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, from the number of the movents; that
is, one motion is made by one movent only, and
another by the concourse of many movents.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fourthly, from the position of that line in which
a body is moved, in respect of some other line;
and from hence one motion is called <em>perpendicular</em>,
another <em>oblique</em>, another <em>parallel</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fifthly, from the position of the movent in respect
of the moved body; from whence one motion
is <em>pulsion</em> or driving, another <em>traction</em> or drawing.
<em>Pulsion</em>, when the movent makes the moved body
go before it; and <em>traction</em>, when it makes it follow.
Again, there are two sorts of <em>pulsion</em>; one, when
the motions of the movent and moved body begin
both together, which may be called <em>trusion</em> or
<em>thrusting</em> and <em>vection</em>; the other, when the movent
is first moved, and afterwards the moved body,
which motion is called <em>percussion</em> or <em>stroke</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sixthly, motion is considered sometimes from
the effect only which the movent works in the
moved body, which is usually called <em>moment</em>. Now
<em>moment is the excess of motion which the movent
has above the motion or endeavour of the resisting
body</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Seventhly, it may be considered from the diversity
of the <em>medium</em>; as one motion may be made
in <em>vacuity</em> or <em>empty place</em>; another in a <em>fluid</em>;
another in a <em>consistent medium</em>, that is, a <em>medium</em>
whose parts are by some power so <em>consistent</em> and
<em>cohering</em>, that no part of the same will yield to the
movent, unless the whole yield also.</p>

<p class='c001'>Eighthly, when a moved body is considered as
having parts, there arises another distinction of
motion into <em>simple</em> and <em>compound</em>. <em>Simple</em>, when
all the several parts describe several equal lines;
<em>compounded</em>, when the lines described are unequal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The way by which the first endeavour of bodies moved tendeth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.5'></a>5. All endeavour tends towards that part, that is
to say, in that way which is determined by the
motion of the movent, if the movent be but one;
or, if there be many movents, in that way which
their concourse determines. For example, if a
moved body have direct motion, its first endeavour
will be in a strait line; if it have circular motion,
its first endeavour will be in the circumference of a
circle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In motion, which it made by concourse, one of the movents ceasing, the endeavour is made by the way by which the rest tend.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.6'></a>6. And whatsoever the line be, in which a
body has its motion from the concourse of two
movents, as soon as in any point thereof the force
of one of the movents ceases, there immediately
the former endeavour of that body will be changed
into an endeavour in the line of the other movent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wherefore, when any body is carried on by
the concourse of two winds, one of those winds
ceasing, the endeavour and motion of that body
will be in that line, in which it would have been
carried by that wind alone which blows still. And
in the describing of a circle, where that which is
moved has its motion determined by a movent in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>tangent, and by the radius which keeps it in a certain
distance from the centre, if the retention of
the radius cease, that endeavour, which was in the
circumference of the circle, will now be in the tangent,
that is, in a strait line. For, seeing endeavour
is computed in a less part of the circumference
than can be given, that is, in a point, the
way by which a body is moved in the circumference
is compounded of innumerable strait lines, of which
every one is less than can be given; which are
therefore called points. Wherefore when any body,
which is moved in the circumference of a circle, is
freed from the retention of the radius, it will proceed
in one of those strait lines, that is, in a
tangent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>All endeavour is propagated in infinitum.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.7'></a>7. All endeavour, whether strong or weak, is
propagated to infinite distance; for it is motion. If
therefore the first endeavour of a body be made in
space which is empty, it will always proceed with
the same velocity; for it cannot be supposed that
it can receive any resistance at all from empty
space; and therefore, (by <a href='#art9.7'>art. 7</a>, chap, <span class='fss'>IX</span>) it will
always proceed in the same way and with the
same swiftness. And if its endeavour be in space
which is filled, yet, seeing endeavour is motion,
that which stands next in its way shall be removed,
and endeavour further, and again remove that
which stands next, and so infinitely. Wherefore
the propagation of endeavour, from one part of full
space to another, proceeds infinitely. Besides, it
reaches in any instant to any distance, how great
soever. For in the same instant in which the first
part of the full <em>medium</em> removes that which is next
it, the second also removes that part which is next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>to it; and therefore all endeavour, whether it be in
empty or in full space, proceeds not only to any
distance, how great soever, but also in any time,
how little soever, that is, in an instant. Nor makes
it any matter, that endeavour, by proceeding, grows
weaker and weaker, till at last it can no longer be
perceived by sense; for motion may be insensible;
and I do not here examine things by sense and experience,
but by reason.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How much greater the velocity or magnitude is of a movent, so much the greater is the efficacy thereof upon any other body in its way.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art15.8'></a>8. When two movents are of equal magnitude,
the swifter of them works with greater force than
the slower, upon a body that resists their motion.
Also, if two movents have equal velocity, the
greater of them works with more force than the
less. For where the magnitude is equal, the movent
of greater velocity makes the greater impression
upon that body upon which it falls; and where the
velocity is equal, the movent of greater magnitude
falling upon the same point, or an equal part of
another body, loses less of its velocity, because the
resisting body works only upon that part of the
movent which it touches, and therefore abates the
impetus of that part only; whereas in the mean
time the parts, which are not touched, proceed,
and retain their whole force, till they also come to
be touched; and their force has some effect.
Wherefore, for example, in batteries a longer than
a shorter piece of timber of the same thickness and
velocity, and a thicker than a slenderer piece of
the same length and velocity, work a greater
effect upon the wall.</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#art16.1'>1.</a> The velocity of any body, in what time soever it be computed,

proportion of their impetus to one another will be compounded
of the proportions of length to length, and time to time reciprocally
taken.—<a href='#art16.8'>8.</a> If a body be carried on with uniform motion
by two movents together, which meet in an angle, the line by
which it passes will be a strait line, subtending the complement
of that angle to two right angles.—<a href='#art16.9'>9</a>, &#38;c. If a body be
carried by two movents together, one of them being moved
with uniform, the other with accelerated motion, and the proportion
of their lengths to their times being explicable in
numbers, how to find out what line that body describes.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The velocity of any body, in what time soever it be computed, is that which is made of the multiplication of the impetus or quickness of its motion into the time.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.1'></a>1. The velocity of any body, in whatsoever time it
be moved, has its quantity determined by the sum
of all the several quicknesses or impetus, which it
hath in the several points of the time of the body's
motion. For seeing velocity, (by the definition of
it, chap, <span class='fss'>VIII</span>, <a href='#art8.15'>art. 15</a>) is that power by which a
body can in a certain time pass through a certain
length; and quickness of motion or impetus, (by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>chap. <span class='fss'>XV</span>, <a href='#art15.2.2'>art. 2, num. 2</a>) is velocity taken in one
point of time only, all the impetus, together taken
in all the points of time, will be the same thing
with the mean impetus multiplied into the whole
time, or which is all one, will be the velocity of the
whole motion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. If the impetus be the same in every
point, any strait line representing it may be taken
for the measure of time: and the quicknesses or
impetus applied ordinately to any strait line
making an angle with it, and representing the way
of the body's motion, will design a parallelogram
which shall represent the velocity of the whole
motion. But if the impetus or quickness of motion
begin from rest and increase uniformly, that
is, in the same proportion continually with the
times which are passed, the whole velocity of the
motion shall be represented by a triangle, one side
whereof is the whole time, and the other the
greatest impetus acquired in that time; or else by
a parallelogram, one of whose sides is the whole
time of motion, and the other, half the greatest
impetus; or lastly, by a parallelogram having for
one side a mean proportional between the whole
time and the half of that time, and for the other
side the half of the greatest impetus. For both
these parallelograms are equal to one another, and
severally equal to the triangle which is made of
the whole line of time, and of the greatest acquired
impetus; as is demonstrated in the elements
of geometry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In all motion, the lengths which are passed through are to one another, as the products made by the impetus multiplied into time.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.2'></a>2. In all uniform motions the lengths which are
transmitted are to one another, as the product of
the mean impetus multiplied into its time, to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>product of the mean impetus multiplied also into
its time.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig16.1'></a>For let A B (in <a href='#fig16.f1'>fig. 1</a>) be the time, and A C the
impetus by which any body passes with uniform
motion through the length D E; and in any part of
the time A B, as in the time A F, let another body
be moved with uniform motion, first, with the same
impetus A C. This body, therefore, in the time
A F with the impetus A C will pass through the
length A F. Seeing, therefore, when bodies are
moved in the same time, and with the same velocity
and impetus in every part of their motion, the
proportion of one length transmitted to another
length transmitted, is the same with that of time
to time, it followeth, that the length transmitted in
the time A B with the impetus A C will be to the
length transmitted in the time A F with the same
impetus A C, as A B itself is to A F, that is, as the
parallelogram A I is to the parallelogram A H,
that is, as the product of the time A B into the
mean impetus A C is to the product of the time
A F into the same impetus A C. Again, let it be
supposed that a body be moved in the time A F,
not with the same but with some other uniform
impetus, as A L. Seeing therefore, one of the
bodies has in all the parts of its motion the impetus
A C, and the other in like manner the impetus
A L, the length transmitted by the body moved
with the impetus A C will be to the length transmitted
by the body moved with the impetus A L,
as A C itself is to A L, that is, as the parallelogram
A H is to the parallelogram F L. Wherefore, by
ordinate proportion it will be, as the parallelogram
A I to the parallelogram F L, that is, as the product
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>of the mean impetus into the time is to the
product of the mean impetus into the time, so the
length transmitted in the time A B with the impetus
A C, to the length transmitted in the time A F
with the impetus A L; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. Seeing, therefore, in uniform motion, as
has been shown, the lengths transmitted are to
one another as the parallelograms which are made
by the multiplication of the mean impetus into the
times, that is, by reason of the equality of the impetus
all the way, as the times themselves, it will
also be, by permutation, as time to length, so time
to length; and in general, to this place are applicable
all the properties and transmutations of analogisms,
which I have set down and demonstrated
in chapter <span class='fss'>XIII</span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.3'></a>3. In motion begun from rest and uniformly
accelerated, that is, where the impetus increaseth
continually according to the proportion of the
times, it will also be, as one product made by the
mean impetus multiplied into the time, to another
product made likewise by the mean impetus multiplied
into the time, so the length transmitted in
the one time to the length transmitted in the other
time.</p>

<p class='c001'>For let A B (in <a href='#fig16.f1'>fig. 1</a>) represent a time; in the
beginning of which time A, let the impetus be as
the point A; but as the time goes on, so let the
impetus increase uniformly, till in the last point of
that time A B, namely in B, the impetus acquired
be B I. Again, let A F represent another time, in
whose beginning A, let the impetus be as the point
itself A; but as the time proceeds, so let the impetus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>increase uniformly, till in the last point F of
the time A F the impetus acquired be F K; and
let D E be the length passed through in the time
A B with impetus uniformly increased. I say, the
length D E is to the length transmitted in the time
A F, as the time A B multiplied into the mean of
the impetus increasing through the time A B, is to
the time A F multiplied into the mean of the impetus
increasing through the time A F.</p>

<p class='c001'>For seeing the triangle A B I is the whole velocity
of the body moved in the time A B, till the

the whole velocity of the body moved in the time

the impetus F K; the length D E to the length

from rest in A till there be acquired the impetus

A F K, that is, if the triangles A B I and A F K be
like, in duplicate proportion of the time A B to the
time A F; but if unlike, in the proportion compounded
of the proportions of A B to A F and of
B I to F K. Wherefore, as A B I is to A F K, so
let D E be to D P; for so, the length transmitted
in the time A B with impetus increasing to B I,
will be to the length transmitted in the time A F
with impetus increasing to F K, as the triangle
A B I is to the triangle A F K; but the triangle
A B I is made by the multiplication of the time
A B into the mean of the impetus increasing to
B I; and the triangle A F K is made by the multiplication
of the time A F into the mean of the

<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>with impetus increasing to B I, to the length D P
which is transmitted in the time A F with impetus

<p class='c001'><a id='cor16.3.3'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>III.</span> In motion uniformly accelerated from

transmitted uniformly in the same time, but with
such impetus as was acquired by the accelerated
motion in the last point of that time, as a triangle
to a parallelogram, which have their altitude and
base common. For seeing the length D E (in <a href='#fig16.f1'>fig. 1</a>)
is passed through with velocity as the triangle
A B I, it is necessary that for the passing through
of a length which is double to D E, the velocity be
as the parallelogram A I; for the parallelogram A I
is double to the triangle A B I.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.4'></a>4. In motion, which beginning from rest is so aclerated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>that the impetus thereof increases continually
in proportion duplicate to the proportion of
the times in which it is made, a length transmitted
in one time will be to a length transmitted in another
time, as the product made by the mean impetus
multiplied into the time of one of those motions, to
the product of the mean impetus multiplied into
the time of the other motion.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig16.2'></a>For let A B (in <a href='#fig16.f2'>fig. 2</a>) represent a time, in whose
first instant A let the impetus be as the point A;
but as the time proceeds, so let the impetus increase
continually in duplicate proportion to that
of the times, till in the last point of time B the
impetus acquired be B I; then taking the point F
anywhere in the time A B, let the impetus F K
acquired in the time A F be ordinately applied to
that point F. Seeing therefore the proportion of
F K to B I is supposed to be duplicate to that of
A F to A B, the proportion of A F to A B will be
subduplicate to that of F K to B I; and that of
A B to A F will be (by chap. <span class='fss'>XIII.</span> <a href='#art13.16'>art. 16</a>) duplicate
to that of B I to F K; and consequently the
point K will be in a parabolical line, whose diameter
is A B and base B I; and for the same
reason, to what point soever of the time A B the
impetus acquired in that time be ordinately applied,
the strait line designing that impetus will be
in the same parabolical line A K I. Wherefore the
mean impetus multiplied into the whole time A B
will be the parabola A K I B, equal to the parallelogram
A M, which parallelogram has for one side
the line of time A B and for the other the line of
the impetus A L, which is two-thirds of the impetus
B I; for every parabola is equal to two-thirds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>of that parallelogram with which it has its
altitude and base common. Wherefore the whole
velocity in A B will be the parallelogram A M, as
being made by the multiplication of the impetus
A L into the time A B. And in like manner, if
F N be taken, which is two-thirds of the impetus
F K, and the parallelogram F O be completed, F O
will be the whole velocity in the time A F, as being
made by the uniform impetus A O or F N multiplied
into the time A F. Let now the length
transmitted in the time A B and with the velocity
A M be the strait line D E; and lastly, let the
length transmitted in the time A F with the velocity
A N be D P; I say that as A M is to A N, or as
the parabola A K I B to the parabola A K F, so is
D E to D P. For as A M is to F L, that is, as A B
is to A F, so let D E be to D G. Now the proportion
of A M to A N is compounded of the proportions
of A M to F L, and of F L to A N. But as
A M to F L, so by construction is D E to D G;
and as F L is to A N (seeing the time in both is the
same, namely, A F), so is the length D G to the
length D P; for lengths transmitted in the same
time are to one another as their velocities are.
Wherefore by ordinate proportion, as A M is to
A N, that is, as the mean impetus A L multiplied
into its time A B, is to the mean impetus A O
multiplied into A F, so is D E to D P; which was
to be proved.</p>

the length D P, so is the parallelogram A M to the
parallelogram A N, and so the parabola A K I B
to the parabola A K F. But the proportion of the
parabola A K I B to the parabola A K F is triplicate
to the proportion which the base B I has to the

For if in the first time the length transmitted be as
1, the length at the end of the second time will be
as 8, at the end of the third time as 27, and at the
end of the fourth time as 64, &#38;c.; which are cubic

length uniformly transmitted in the whole time,
and with impetus all the way equal to that which

of the same altitude and base, that is, as 2 to 3.
For the parabola A K I B is the impetus increasing
in the time A B; and the parallelogram A I is the
greatest uniform impetus multiplied into the same

be as a parabola to a parallelogram, &#38;c., that is,

to that of their times, it would be a labour infinite
and unnecessary. For by the same method by
which I have computed such lengths, as are transmitted
with impetus increasing in single and duplicate
proportion, any man may compute such as are
transmitted with impetus increasing in triplicate,
quadruplicate, or what other proportion he pleases.</p>

<p class='c001'>In making which computation he shall find, that
where the impetus increase in proportion triplicate
to that of the times, there the whole velocity will
be designed by the first parabolaster (of which see
the next chapter); and the lengths transmitted

increase in quadruplicate proportion to that

designed by the second parabolaster, and the

<div class='sidenote'>If two bodies be moved with uniform motion through two lengths, the proportion of those lengths to one another, will be compounded of the proportions of time to time, and impetus to impetus, directly taken.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.6'></a>6. If two bodies with uniform motion transmit
two lengths, each with its own impetus and time,
the proportion of the lengths transmitted will be
compounded of the proportions of time to time,
and impetus to impetus, directly taken.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let two bodies be moved uniformly (as in <a href='#fig16.f3'>fig. 3</a>),
one in the time A B with the impetus A C, the
other in the time A D with the impetus A E. I
say the lengths transmitted have their proportion
to one another compounded of the proportions of
A B to A D, and of A C to A E. For let any
length whatsoever, as Z, be transmitted by one of
the bodies in the time A B with the impetus A C;
and any other length, as X, be transmitted by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>other body in the time A D with the impetus A E;
and let the parallelograms A F and A G be completed.
Seeing now Z is to X (by <a href='#art16.2'>art. 2</a>) as the
impetus A C multiplied into the time A B is to the
impetus A E multiplied into the time A D, that is,
as A F to A G; the proportion of Z to X will be
compounded of the same proportions, of which the
proportion of A F to A G is compounded; but the
proportion of A F to A G is compounded of the
proportions of the side A B to the side A D, and of
the side A C to the side A E (as is evident by the
Elements of Euclid), that is, of the proportions of
the time A B to the time A D, and of the impetus
A C to the impetus A E. Wherefore also the
proportion of Z to X is compounded of the same
proportions of the time A B to the time A D, and
of the impetus A C to the impetus A E; which was
to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor16.6.1'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>I.</span> When two bodies are moved with

of A F to A G would be compounded of
the proportions of A B to A D, and of A C to A E,
that is, of the proportions of A B to A D, and of
A D to A B. Wherefore, A F would be to A G as
A B to A B, that is, equal; and so the two products
made by the multiplication of impetus into time
would be equal; and by consequent, Z would be
equal to X.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor16.6.2'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>II.</span> If two bodies be moved in the same
time, but with different impetus, the lengths transmitted
will be as impetus to impetus. For if the

impetus be A E and A C, the proportion of A G to
D C will be compounded of the proportions of A E
to A C and of A D to A D, that is, of the proportions
of A E to A C and of A C to A C; and so
the proportion of A G to D C, that is, the proportion
of length to length, will be as A E to A C, that
is, as that of impetus to impetus. In like manner,
if two bodies be moved uniformly, and both of
them with the same impetus, but in different
times, the proportion of the lengths transmitted by
them will be as that of their times. For if they
have both the same impetus A C, and their different
times be A B and A D, the proportion of A F
to D C will be compounded of the proportions of
A B to A D and of A C to A C; that is, of the
proportions of A B to A D and of A D to A D;
and therefore the proportion of A F to D C, that is,
of length to length, will be the same with that of
A B to A D, which is the proportion of time to time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If two bodies pass through two lengths with uniform motion, the proportion of their times to one another, will be compounded of the proportions of length to length, and impetus to impetus reciprocally taken; also the proportion of their impetus to one another, will be compounded of the proportions of length to length, and time to time reciprocally taken.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.7'></a>7. If two bodies pass through two lengths with
uniform motion, the proportion of the times in
which they are moved will be compounded of the
proportions of length to length and impetus to

<p class='c001'>For let any two lengths be given, as (in the same
<a href='#fig16.f3'>fig. 3</a>) Z and X, and let one of them be transmitted
with the impetus A C, the other with the impetus
A E. I say the proportion of the times in which
they are transmitted, will be compounded of the
proportions of Z to X, and of A E, which is the
impetus with which X is transmitted, to A C, the
impetus with which Z is transmitted. For seeing
A F is the product of the impetus A C multiplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>into the time A B, the time of motion through Z
will be a line, which is made by the application of
the parallelogram A F to the strait line A C, which
line is A B; and therefore A B is the time of
motion through Z. In like manner, seeing A G is
the product of the impetus A E multiplied into the
time A D, the time of motion through X will be a
line which is made by the application of A G to the
strait line A D; but A D is the time of motion
through X. Now the proportion of A B to A D
is compounded of the proportions of the parallelogram
A F to the parallelogram A G, and of the
impetus A E to the impetus A C; which may be
demonstrated thus. Put the parallelograms in
order A F, A G, D C, and it will be manifest that
the proportion of A F to D C is compounded of the
proportions of A F to A G and of A G to D C; but
A F is to D C as A B to A D; wherefore also the
proportion of A B to A D is compounded of the
proportions of A F to A G and of A G to D C.
And because the length Z is to the length X as
A F is to A G, and the impetus A E to the impetus
A C as A G to D C, therefore the proportion of
A B to A D will be compounded of the proportions
of the length Z to the length X, and of the impetus
A E to the impetus A C; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the same manner it may be proved, that in
two uniform motions the proportion of the impetus
is compounded of the proportions of length to
length and of time to time reciprocally taken.</p>

<p class='c001'>For if we suppose A C (in the same <a href='#fig16.f3'>fig. 3</a>) to be

is passed through, the demonstration will proceed
as in the last article.</p>

and let the body be placed in the point of their
concourse, A. I say the line which that body describes
with its motion is a strait line. For let the

A D be drawn; and in the strait line A B
let any point E be taken; and from it let E F be

Seeing therefore both the motions are made in the

will be in C D; and in like manner, when A C is
in B D, the body will be in B D. But A B is in
C D at the same time when A C is in B D; and
therefore the body will be in C D and B D at the
same time; wherefore it will be in the common
point D. Again, seeing the motion from A C to
B D is uniform, that is, the spaces transmitted by
it are in proportion to one another as the times
in which they are transmitted, when A C is in E F,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the proportion of A B to A E will be the same with
that of E F to E G, that is, of the time A C to the

increasing from rest, till it be equal to that of the
uniform motion, and with such acceleration, that
the proportion of the lengths transmitted be every
where triplicate to that of the times in which they
are transmitted; the line, in which that body is
moved, will be the crooked line of the first semiparabolaster
of two means, whose base is the impetus
last acquired.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig16.6'></a>Let the strait line A B (in the <a href='#fig16.5'>6th figure</a>) be moved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>uniformly to C D; and let another movent A C be
moved at the same time to B D with motion so
accelerated, that the proportion of the lengths
transmitted be everywhere triplicate to the proportion
of their times; and let the impetus acquired
in the end of that motion be B D, equal to the
strait line A C; and lastly, let A G D be the crooked
line of the first semiparabolaster of two means. I
say, that by the concourse of the two movents
together, the body will be always in that crooked
line A G D. For let the parallelogram A B D C be
completed; and from the point E, taken anywhere
in the strait line A B, let E F be drawn parallel to
A C, and cutting the crooked line in G; and
through the point G let H I be drawn parallel to
the strait lines A B and C D. Seeing therefore the
proportion of A B to A E is, by supposition, triplicate
to the proportion of E F to E G, that is, of the
time A C to the time A H, at the same time when
A C is in E F, A B will be in H I; and therefore
the moved body will be in the common point G.
And so it will always be, in what part soever of
A B the point E be taken; and by consequent, the
body will always be in the crooked line A G D;
which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.11'></a>11. By the same method it may be shown, what
line it is that is made by the motion of a body
carried by the concourse of any two movents,
which are moved one of them uniformly, the other
with acceleration, but in such proportions of spaces
and times as are explicable by numbers, as <em>duplicate</em>,
<em>triplicate</em>, &#38;c., or such as may be designed
by any broken number whatsoever. For which
this is the rule. Let the two numbers of the length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>and time be added together; and let their sum be
the denominator of a fraction, whose numerator
must be the number of the length. Seek this fraction
in the table of the third <a href='#art17.3'>article</a> of the <span class='fss'>XVII</span>th
chapter; and the line sought will be that, which
denominates the three-sided figure noted on the
left hand; and the kind of it will be that, which is
numbered above over the fraction. For example,
let there be a concourse of two movents, whereof
one is moved uniformly, the other with motion so
accelerated, that the spaces are to the times as 5
to 3. Let a fraction be made whose denominator
is the sum of 5 and 3, and the numerator 5, namely
the fraction <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>. Seek in the table, and you will
find <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> to be the third in that row, which belongs
to the three-sided figure of four means. Wherefore
the line of motion made by the concourse of two
such movents, as are last of all described, will be
the crooked line of the third parabolaster of four
means.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.12'></a>12. If motion be made by the concourse of two
movents, whereof one is moved uniformly, the
other beginning from rest in the angle of concourse
with any acceleration whatsoever; the movent,
which is moved uniformly, shall put forward the
moved body in the several parallel spaces, less
than if both the movents had uniform motion; and
still less and less, as the motion of the other
movent is more and more accelerated.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig16.7'></a>Let the body be placed in A, (in the <a href='#fig16.f7'>7th figure</a>)
and be moved by two movents, by one with uniform
motion from the strait line A B to the strait
line C D parallel to it; and by the other with any
acceleration, from the strait line A C to the strait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>line B D parallel to it; and in the parallelogram
A B D C let a space be taken between any two parallels
E F and G H. I say, that whilst the movent
A C passes through the latitude which is between
E F and G H, the body is less moved forwards from
A B towards C D, than it would have been, if the
motion from A C to B D had been uniform.</p>

<p class='c001'>For suppose that whilst the body is made to
descend to the parallel E F by the power of the
movent from A C towards B D, the same body in
the same time is moved forwards to any point F
in the line E F, by the power of the movent from
A B towards C D; and let the strait line A F be
drawn and produced indeterminately, cutting G H
in H. Seeing therefore, it is as A E to A G, so E F
to G H; if A C should descend towards B D with
uniform motion, the body in the time G H, (for I
make A C and its parallels the measure of time,)
would be found in the point H. But because A C
is supposed to be moved towards B D with motion
continually accelerated, that is, in greater proportion
of space to space, than of time to time, in the
time G H the body will be in some parallel beyond
it, as between G H and B D. Suppose now that in
the end of the time G H it be in the parallel I K,
and in I K let I L be taken equal to G H. When
therefore the body is in the parallel I K, it will be
in the point L. Wherefore when it was in the
parallel G H, it was in some point between G and
H, as in the point M; but if both the motions had
been uniform, it had been in the point H; and
therefore whilst the movent A C passes over the
latitude which is between E F and G H, the body is
less moved forwards from A B towards C D, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>it would have been, if both the motions had been
uniform; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.13'></a>13. Any length being given, which is passed
through in a given time with uniform motion, to
find out what length shall be passed through in the
same time with motion uniformly accelerated, that
is, with such motion that the proportion of the
lengths passed through be continually duplicate to
that of their times, and that the line of the impetus
last acquired be equal to the line of the whole time
of the motion.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig16.8'></a>Let A B (in the <a href='#fig16.f8'>8th figure</a>) be a length, transmitted
with uniform motion in the time A C; and
let it be required to find another length, which
shall be transmitted in the same time with motion
uniformly accelerated, so that the line of the impetus
last acquired be equal to the strait line A C.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the parallelogram A B D C be completed;
and let B D be divided in the middle at E; and
between B E and B D let B F be a mean proportional;
and let A F be drawn and produced till it
meet with C D produced in G; and lastly, let the
parallelogram A C G H be completed. I say, A H
is the length required.</p>

<p class='c001'>For as duplicate proportion is to single proportion,
so let A H be to A I, that is, let A I be the
half of A H; and let I K be drawn parallel to the
strait line A C, and cutting the diagonal A D in K,
and the strait line A G in L. Seeing therefore A I
is the half of A H, I L will also be the half of B D,
that is, equal to B E; and I K equal to B F; for
B D, that is, G H, B F, and B E, that is, I L, being
continual proportionals, A H, A B and A I will
also be continual proportionals. But as A B is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>A I, that is, as A H is to A B, so is B D to I K, and
so also is G H, that is, B D to B F; and therefore
B F and I K are equal. Now the proportion of
A H to A I is duplicate to the proportion of A B
to A I, that is, to that of B D to I K, or of G H to
I K. Wherefore the point K will be in a parabola,
whose diameter is A H, and base G H, which G H
is equal to A C. The body therefore proceeding
from rest in A, with motion uniformly accelerated
in the time A C, when it has passed through the
length A H, will acquire the impetus G H equal to
the time A C, that is, such impetus, as that with it
the body will pass through the length A C in the
time A C. Wherefore any length being given, &#38;c.,
which was propounded to be done.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.14'></a>14. Any length being given, which in a given
time is transmitted with uniform motion, to find
out what length shall be transmitted in the same
time with motion so accelerated, that the lengths
transmitted be continually in triplicate proportion
to that of their times, and the line of the impetus
last of all acquired be equal to the line of time
given.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig16.9'></a>Let the given length A B (in the <a href='#fig16.f9'>9th figure</a>) be
transmitted with uniform motion in the time A C;
and let it be required to find what length shall be
transmitted in the same time with motion so accelerated,
that the lengths transmitted be continually
in triplicate proportion to that of their times, and
the impetus last acquired be equal to the time
given.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the parallelogram A B D C be completed;
and let B D be so divided in E, that B E be a third
part of the whole B D; and let B F be a mean proportional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>between B D and B E; and let A F be
drawn and produced till it meet the strait line C D
in G; and lastly, let the parallelogram A C G H be
completed. I say, A H is the length required.</p>

<p class='c001'>For as triplicate proportion is to single proportion,
so let A H be to another line, A I, that is,
make A I a third part of the whole A H; and let
I K be drawn parallel to the strait line A C, cutting
the diagonal A D in K, and the strait line A G in
L; then, as A B is to A I, so let A I be to another,
A N; and from the point N let N Q be drawn parallel
to A C, cutting A G, A D, and F K produced
in P, M, and O; and last of all, let F O and L M
be drawn, which will be equal and parallel to the
strait lines B N and I N. By this construction, the
lengths transmitted A H, A B, A I, and A N, will
be continual proportionals; and, in like manner,
the times G H, B F, I L and N P, that is, N Q,
N O, N M and N P, will be continual proportionals,
and in the same proportion with A H, A B, A I
and A N. Wherefore the proportion of A H, A B, A I
and A N. Wherefore the proportion of A H to
A N is the same with that of B D, that is, of N Q
to N P; and the proportion of N Q to N P triplicate
to that of N Q to N O, that is, triplicate to
that of B D to I K; wherefore also the length A H
is to the length A N in triplicate proportion to that
of the time B D, to the time I K; and therefore
the crooked line of the first three-sided figure of
two means whose diameter is A H, and base G H
equal to A C, shall pass through the point O; and
consequently, A H shall be transmitted in the time
A C, and shall have its last acquired impetus G H
equal to A C, and the proportions of the lengths
acquired in any of the times triplicate to the proportions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>of the times themselves. Wherefore A H
is the length required to be found out.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the same method, if a length be given which
is transmitted with uniform motion in any given
time, another length may be found out which shall
be transmitted in the same time with motion so
accelerated, that the lengths transmitted shall be
to the times in which they are transmitted, in proportion
quadruplicate, quintuplicate, and so on
infinitely. For if B D be divided in E, so that B D
be to B E as 4 to 1; and there be taken between
B D and B E a mean proportional F B; and as
A H is to A B, so A B be made to a third, and
again so that third to a fourth, and that fourth to
a fifth, A N, so that the proportion of A H to A N
be quadruplicate to that of A H to A B, and the
parallelogram N B F O be completed, the crooked
line of the first three-sided figure of three means
will pass through the point O; and consequently,
the body moved will acquire the impetus G H
equal to A C in the time A C. And so of the rest.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.15'></a>15. Also, if the proportion of the lengths transmitted
be to that of their times, as any number to
any number, the same method serves for the finding
out of the length transmitted with such
impetus, and in such time.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig16.10'></a>For let A C (in the <a href='#fig16.f10'>10th figure</a>) be the time in
which a body is transmitted with uniform motion
from A to B; and the parallelogram A B D C being
completed, let it be required to find out a length
in which that body may be moved in the same time
A C from A, with motion so accelerated, that the
proportion of the lengths transmitted to that of
the times be continually as 3 to 2.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let B D be so divided in E, that B D be to B E
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>as 3 to 2; and between B D and B E let B F be a
mean proportional; and let A F be drawn and produced
till it meet with C D produced in G; and
making A M a mean proportional between A H
and A B, let it be as A M to A B, so A B to A I;
and so the proportion of A H to A I will be to that
of A H to A B as 3 to 2; for of the proportions, of
which that of A H to A M is one, that of A H to
A B is two, and that of A H to A I is three; and
consequently, as 3 to 2 to that of G H to B F, and
(F K being drawn parallel to B I and cutting A D
in K) so likewise to that of G H or B D to I K.
Wherefore the proportion of the length A H to A I
is to the proportion of the time B D to I K as 3 to
2; and therefore if in the time A C the body be
moved with accelerated motion, as was propounded,
till it acquire the impetus H G equal to
A C, the length transmitted in the same time will
be A H.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.16'></a>16. But if the proportion of the lengths to that
of the times had been as 4 to 3, there should then
have been taken two mean proportionals between
A H and A B, and their proportion should have
been continued one term further, so that A H to
A B might have three of the same proportions,
of which A H to A I has four; and all things else
should have been done as is already shown. Now
the way how to interpose any number of means
between two lines given, is not yet found out.
Nevertheless this may stand for a general rule; <em>if
there be a time given, and a length be transmitted
in that time with uniform motion; as for example,
if the time be</em> A C, <em>and the length</em> A B, <em>the strait
line</em> A G, <em>which determines the length</em> C G <em>or</em> A H,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span><em>transmitted in the same time</em> A C <em>with any accelerated
motion, shall so cut</em> B D <em>in</em> F, <em>that</em> B F
<em>shall be a mean proportional between</em> B D <em>and</em>
B E, B E <em>being so taken in</em> B D, <em>that the proportion
of length to length be everywhere to the proportion
of time to time, as the whole</em> B D <em>is to its
part</em> B E.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.17'></a>17. If in a given time two lengths be transmitted,
one with uniform motion, the other with
motion accelerated in any proportion of the lengths
to the times; and again, in part of the same time,
parts of the same lengths be transmitted with the
same motions, the whole length will exceed the
other length in the same proportion in which one
part exceeds the other part.</p>

<p class='c001'>For example, let A B (in the <a href='#fig16.f8'>8th figure</a>) be a
length transmitted in the time A C, with uniform
motion; and let A H be another length transmitted
in the same time with motion uniformly accelerated,
so that the impetus last acquired be G H
equal to A C; and in A H let any part A I be taken,
and transmitted in part of the time A C with uniform
motion; and let another part A B be taken
and transmitted in the same part of the time A C
with motion uniformly accelerated; I say, that as
A H is to A B, so will A B be to A I.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let B D be drawn parallel and equal to H G,
and divided in the midst at E, and between B D and
B E let a mean proportional be taken as B F;
and the strait line A G, by the demonstration of
<a href='#art16.13'>art. 13</a>, shall pass through F. And dividing A H
in the midst at I, A B shall be a mean proportional
between A H and A I. Again, because A I and A B
are described by the same motions, if I K be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>drawn parallel and equal to B F or A M, and
divided in the midst at N, and between I K and
I N be taken the mean proportional I L, the strait
line A F will, by the demonstration of the same
<a href='#art16.13'>art. 13</a>, pass through L. And dividing A B in the
midst at O, the line A I will be a mean proportional
between A B and A O. Where A B is divided in
I and O, in like manner as A H is divided in B and
I; and as A H to A B, so is A B to A I. Which
was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. Also as A H to A B, so is H B to B I;
and so also B I to I O.</p>

<p class='c001'>And as this, where one of the motions is uniformly
accelerated, is proved out of the demonstration
of <a href='#art16.13'>art. 13</a>; so, when the accelerations are
in double proportion to the times, the same may be
proved by the demonstration of <a href='#art16.14'>art. 14</a>; and by
the same method in all other accelerations, whose
proportions to the times are explicable in numbers.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.18'></a>18. If two sides, which contain an angle in any
parallelogram, be moved in the same time to the
sides opposite to them, one of them with uniform
motion, the other with motion uniformly accelerated;
that side, which is moved uniformly, will
affect as much with its concourse through the
whole length transmitted, as it would do if the
other motion were also uniform, and the length
transmitted by it in the same time were a mean
proportional between the whole and the half.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig16.11'></a>Let the side A B of the parallelogram A B D C,
(in the <a href='#fig16.f11'>11th figure</a>) be understood to be moved with
uniform motion till it be coincident with C D; and
let the time of that motion be A C or B D. Also
in the same time let the side A C be understood to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>be moved with motion uniformly accelerated, till
it be coincident with B D; then dividing A B in
the middle in E, let A F be made a mean proportional
between A B and A E; and drawing F G
parallel to A C, let the side A C be understood to
be moved in the same time A C with uniform
motion till it be coincident with F G. I say, the
whole A B confers as much to the velocity of the
body placed in A, when the motion of A C is uniformly
accelerated till it comes to B D, as the part
A F confers to the same, when the side A C is
moved uniformly and in the same time to F G.</p>

<p class='c001'>For seeing A F is a mean proportional between
the whole A B and its half A E, B D will (by the
<a href='#art16.13'>13th article</a>) be the last impetus acquired by A C,
with motion uniformly accelerated till it come to
the same B D; and consequently, the strait line
F B will be the excess, by which the length, transmitted
by A C with motion uniformly accelerated,
will exceed the length transmitted by the same
A C in the same time with uniform motion, and
with impetus every where equal to B D. Wherefore,
if the whole A B be moved uniformly to C D
in the same time in which A C is moved uniformly
to F G, the part F B, seeing it concurs not at all
with the motion of the side A C which is supposed
to be moved only to F G, will confer nothing to its
motion. Again, supposing the side A C to be
moved to B D with motion uniformly accelerated,
the side A B with its uniform motion to C D will
less put forwards the body when it is accelerated
in all the parallels, than when it is not at all accelerated;
and by how much the greater the acceleration
is, by so much the less it will put it forwards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>as is shown in the <a href='#art16.12'>12th article</a>. When
therefore A C is in F G with accelerated motion,
the body will not be in the side C D at the point G,
but at the point D; so that G D will be the excess,
by which the length transmitted with accelerated
motion to B D exceeds the length transmitted with
uniform motion to F G; so that the body by its
acceleration avoids the action of the part A F, and
comes to the side C D in the time A C, and makes
the length C D, which is equal to the length A B.
Wherefore uniform motion from A B to C D in the
time A C, works no more in the whole length A B
upon the body uniformly accelerated from A C to
B D, than if A C were moved in the same time
with uniform motion to F G; the difference consisting
only in this, that when A B works upon the
body uniformly moved from A C to F G, that, by
which the accelerated motion exceeds the uniform
motion, is altogether in F B or G D; but when the
same A B works upon the body accelerated, that,
by which the accelerated motion exceeds the uniform
motion, is dispersed through the whole length
A B or C D, yet, so that if it were collected and
put together, it would be equal to the same F B or
G D. Wherefore, if two sides which contain an
angle, &#38;c.; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art16.19'></a>19. If two transmitted lengths have to their
times any other proportion explicable by number,
and the side A B be so divided in E, that A B be
to A E in the same proportion which the lengths
transmitted have to the times in which they are
transmitted, and between A B and A E there be
taken a mean proportional A F; it may be shown
by the same method, that the side, which is moved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>with uniform motion, works as much with its concourse
through the whole length A B, as it would
do if the other motion were also uniform, and the
length transmitted in the same time A C were that
mean proportional A F.</p>

<p class='c001'>And thus much concerning motion by concourse.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Definition of a deficient figure.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art17.1'></a>1. I call those <em>deficient figures</em> which may be
understood to be generated by the uniform motion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>of some quantity, which decreases continually, till
at last it have no magnitude at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Definitions of a complete figure; of the complement of a deficient figure; and of proportions which are proportional &#38; commensurable to one another.</div>

<p class='c001'>And I call that a <em>complete figure</em>, answering to
a deficient figure, which is generated with the
same motion and in the same time, by a quantity
which retains always its whole magnitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <em>complement</em> of a deficient figure is that which
being added to the deficient figure makes it complete.</p>

<p class='c001'>Four proportions are said to be <em>proportional</em>,
when the first of them is to the second as the third
is to the fourth. For example, if the first proportion
be duplicate to the second, and again, the
third be duplicate to the fourth, those proportions
are said to be <em>proportional</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>And <em>commensurable</em> proportions are those, which
are to one another as number to number. As
when to a proportion given, one proportion is
duplicate, another triplicate, the duplicate proportion
will be to the triplicate proportion as 2 to 3;
but to the given proportion it will be as 2 to 1;
and therefore I call those three proportions <em>commensurable</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The proportion of a deficient figure to its complement.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art17.2'></a>2. A deficient figure, which is made by a quantity
continually decreasing to nothing by proportions
everywhere proportional and commensurable, is to
its complement, as the proportion of the whole
altitude to an altitude diminished in any time is
to the proportion of the whole quantity, which
describes the figure, to the same quantity diminished
in the same time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the quantity A B (in <a href='#fig17.f1'>fig. 1</a>), by its motion
through the altitude A C, describe the complete
figure A D; and again, let the same quantity, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>decreasing continually to nothing in C, describe
the deficient figure A B E F C, whose complement
will be the figure B D C F E. Now let A B be
supposed to be moved till it lie in G K, so that the
altitude diminished be G C, and A B diminished
be G E; and let the proportion of the whole altitude
A C to the diminished altitude G C, be, for
example, triplicate to the proportion of the whole
quantity A B or G K to the diminished quantity
G E. And in like manner, let H I be taken equal
to G E, and let it be diminished to H F; and let
the proportion of G C to H C be triplicate to that
of H I to H F; and let the same be done in as
many parts of the strait line A C as is possible;
and a line be drawn through the points B, E, F
and C. I say the deficient figure A B E F C is to
its complement B D C F E as 3 to 1, or as the proportion
of A C to G C is to the proportion of A B,
that is, of G K to G E.</p>

<p class='c001'>For (by <a href='#art15.2'>art. 2</a>, chapter <span class='fss'>XV.</span>) the proportion of
the complement B E F C D to the deficient figure
A B E F C is all the proportions of D B to B A,
O E to E G, Q F to F H, and of all the lines
parallel to D B terminated in the line B E F C, to
all the parallels to A B terminated in the same
points of the line B E F C. And seeing the proportions
of D B to O E, and of D B to Q F &#38;c.
are everywhere triplicate of the proportions of A B
to G E, and of A B to H F &#38;c. the proportions of
H F to A B, and of G E to A B &#38;c. (by <a href='#art13.16'>art. 16</a>,
chap. <span class='fss'>XIII.</span>), are triplicate of the proportions of
Q F to D B, and of O E to D B &#38;c. and therefore
the deficient figure A B E F C, which is the aggregate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>of all the lines H F, G E, A B, &#38;c. is triple
to the complement B E F C D made of all the lines
Q F, O E, D B, &#38;c.; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>It follows from hence, that the same complement
B E F C D is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> of the whole parallelogram. And
by the same method may be calculated in all other
deficient figures, generated as above declared, the
proportion of the parallelogram to either of its
parts; as that when the parallels increase from a
point in the same proportion, the parallelogram
will be divided into two equal triangles; when
one increase is double to the other, it will be
divided into a semiparabola and its complement,
or into 2 and 1.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same construction standing, the same conclusion
may otherwise be demonstrated thus.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the strait line C B be drawn cutting G K in
L, and through L let M N be drawn parallel to the
strait line A C; wherefore the parallelograms G M
and L D will be equal. Then let L K be divided
into three equal parts, so that it may be to one of
those parts in the same proportion which the proportion
of A C to G C, or of G K to G L, hath to
the proportion of G K to G E. Therefore L K will
be to one of those three parts as the arithmetical
proportion between G K and G L is to the arithmetical
proportion between G K and the same G K
wanting the third part of L K; and K E will be
somewhat greater than a third of L K. Seeing
now the altitude A G or M L is, by reason of the
continual decrease, to be supposed less than any
quantity that can be given; L K, which is intercepted
between the diagonal B C and the side B D,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>will be also less than any quantity that can be
given; and consequently, if G be put so near to A
in <i>g</i>, as that the difference between C <i>g</i> and C A
be less than any quantity that can be assigned,
the difference also between C <i>l</i> (removing L to <i>l</i>)
and C B, will be less than any quantity that can be
assigned; and the line <i>g l</i> being drawn and produced
to the line B D in <i>k</i>, cutting the crooked
line in <i>e</i>, the proportion of G <i>k</i> to G <i>l</i> will still be
triplicate to the proportion of G <i>k</i> to G <i>e</i>, and the
difference between <i>k</i> and <i>e</i>, the third part of <i>k l</i>,
will be less than any quantity that can be given;
and therefore the parallelogram <i>e</i> D will differ
from a third part of the parallelogram A <i>e</i> by a
less difference than any quantity that can be
assigned. Again, let H I be drawn parallel and
equal to G E, cutting C B in P, the crooked line in
F, and O E in I, and the proportion of C <i>g</i> to C H
will be triplicate to the proportion of H F to H P,
and I F will be greater than the third part of P I.
But again, setting H in <i>h</i> so near to <i>g</i>, as that the
difference between C <i>h</i> and C <i>g</i> may be but as a
point, the point P will also in <i>p</i> be so near to <i>l</i>,
as that the difference between C <i>p</i> and C <i>l</i> will be
but as a point; and drawing <i>h p</i> till it meet with
B D in <i>i</i>, cutting the crooked line in <i>f</i> and having
drawn <i>e o</i> parallel to B D, cutting D C in <i>o</i>, the parallelogram
<i>f o</i> will differ less from the third part of
the parallelogram <i>g f</i>, than by any quantity that
can be given. And so it will be in all other spaces
generated in the same manner. Wherefore the
differences of the arithmetical and geometrical
means, which are but as so many points B, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, &#38;c.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>(seeing the whole figure is made up of so many
indivisible spaces) will constitute a certain line,
such as is the line B E F C, which will divide the
complete figure A D into two parts, whereof one,
namely, A B E F C, which I call a deficient figure,
is triple to the other, namely, B D C F E, which I
call the complement thereof. And whereas the
proportion of the altitudes to one another is in
this case everywhere triplicate to that of the
decreasing quantities to one another; in the same
manner, if the proportion of the altitudes had
been everywhere quadruplicate to that of the decreasing
quantities, it might have been demonstrated
that the deficient figure had been quadruple
to its complement; and so in any other proportion.
Wherefore, a deficient figure, which is made, &#38;c.
which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same rule holdeth also in the diminution of
the bases of cylinders, as is demonstrated in the
<a href='#art15.2'>second article</a> of chapter <span class='fss'>XV.</span></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The proportion of deficient figures to the parallelograms in which they are described, set forth in a table.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art17.3'></a>3. By this proposition, the magnitudes of all
deficient figures, when the proportions by which
their bases decrease continually are proportional
to those by which their altitudes decrease, may be
compared with the magnitudes of their complements;
and consequently, with the magnitudes of
their complete figures. And they will be found to
be, as I have set them down in the following
tables; in which I compare a parallelogram with
three-sided figures; and first, with a strait-lined
triangle, made by the base of the parallelogram
continually decreasing in such manner, that the
altitudes be always in proportion to one another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>as the bases are, and so the triangle will be equal
to its complement; or the proportions of the altitudes
and bases will be as 1 to 1, and then the
triangle will be half the parallelogram. Secondly,
with that three-sided figure which is made by the
continual decreasing of the bases in subduplicate
proportion to that of the altitudes; and so the
deficient figure will be double to its complement,
and to the parallelogram as 2 to 3. Then, with
that where the proportion of the altitudes is triplicate
to that of the bases; and then the deficient
figure will be triple to its complement, and to the
parallelogram as 3 to 4. Also the proportion of
the altitudes to that of the bases may be as 3 to 2;
and then the deficient figure will be to its complement
as 3 to 2, and to the parallelogram as 3 to 5;
and so forwards, according as more mean proportionals
are taken, or as the proportions are more
multiplied, as may be seen in the following table.
For example, if the bases decrease so, that the
proportion of the altitudes to that of the bases be
always as 5 to 2, and it be demanded what proportion
the figure made has to the parallelogram,
which is supposed to be unity; then, seeing that
where the proportion is taken five times, there
must be four means; look in the table amongst
the three-sided figures of four means, and seeing
the proportion was as 5 to 2, look in the uppermost
row for the number 2, and descending in
the second column till you meet with that three-sided
figure, you will find <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub>; which shows that the
deficient figure is to the parallelogram as <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub> to 1,
or as 5 to 7.

<div class='sidenote'>Description &#38; production of the same figures.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art17.4'></a>4. Now for the better understanding of the
nature of these three-sided figures, I will show
how they may be described by points; and first,
those which are in the first column of the table.
<a id='fig17.2'></a>Any parallelogram being described, as A B C D
(in <a href='#fig17.f2'>figure 2</a>) let the diagonal B D be drawn;
and the strait-lined triangle B C D will be half the
parallelogram; then let any number of lines, as
E F, be drawn parallel to the side B C, and cutting
the diagonal B D in G; and let it be everywhere,
as E F to E G, so E G to another, E H; and through
all the points H let the line B H H D be drawn;
and the figure B H H D C will be that which I call
a three-sided figure of one mean, because in three
proportionals, as E F, E G and E H, there is but
one mean, namely, E G; and this three-sided
figure will be <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> of the parallelogram, and is called
a <em>parabola</em>. Again, let it be as E G to E H, so E H
to another, E I, and let the line B I I D be drawn,
making the three-sided figure B I I D C; and this
will be <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> of the parallelogram, and is by many
called a <em>cubic parabola</em>. In like manner, if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>proportions be further continued in E F, there will
be made the rest of the three-sided figures of the
first column; which I thus demonstrate. Let there
be drawn strait lines, as H K and G L, parallel to
the base D C. Seeing therefore the proportion of
E F to E H is duplicate to that of E F to E G, or of
B C to B L, that is, of C D to L G, or of K M (producing
K H to A D in M) to K H, the proportion
of B C to B K will be duplicate to that of K M to
K H; but as B C is to B K, so is D C or K M to
K N, and therefore the proportion of K M to K N
is duplicate to that of K M to K H; and so it will
be wheresoever the parallel K M be placed. Wherefore
the figure B H H D C is double to its complement
B H H D A, and consequently <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> of the whole
parallelogram. In the same manner, if through I
be drawn O P I Q parallel and equal to C D, it may
be demonstrated that the proportion of O Q to
O P, that is, of B C to B O, is triplicate that of
O Q to O I, and therefore that the figure B I I D C
is triple to its complement B I I D A, and consequently
¾ of the whole parallelogram, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, such three-sided figures as are in any
of the transverse rows, may be thus described.
<a id='fig17.3'></a>Let A B C D (in <a href='#fig17.f3'>fig. 3</a>) be a parallelogram, whose
diagonal is B D. I would describe in it such
figures, as in the preceding table I call three-sided
figures of three means. Parallel to D C, I draw
E F as often as is necessary, cutting B D in G; and
between E F and E G, I take three proportionals
E H, E I and E K. If now there be drawn lines
through all the points H, I and K, that through all
the points H will make the figure B H D C, which
is the first of those three-sided figures; and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>through all the points I, will make the figure
B I D C, which is the second; and that which is
drawn through all the points K, will make the
figure B K D C the third of those three-sided
figures. The first of these, seeing the proportion
of E F to E G is quadruplicate of that E F to E H,
will be to its complement as 4 to 1, and to the
parallelogram as 4 to 5. The second, seeing the
proportion of E F to E G is to that of E F to E I as
4 to 2, will be double to its complement, and <sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub> or
<sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> of the parallelogram. The third, seeing the <a id='corr255.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='proproportion'>proportion</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_255.11'><ins class='correction' title='proproportion'>proportion</ins></a></span>
of E F to E G is that of E F to E K as
4 to 3, will be to its complement as 4 to 3, and to
the parallelogram as 4 to 7.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig17.4'></a>Any of these figures being described may be
produced at pleasure, thus; let A B C D (in <a href='#fig17.f4'>fig. 4</a>)
be a parallelogram, and in it let the figure B K D C
be described, namely, the third three-sided figure
of three means. Let B D be produced indefinitely
to E, and let E F be made parallel to the base D C,
cutting A D produced in G, and B C produced in
F; and in G E let the point H be so taken, that the
proportion of F E to F G may be quadruplicate to
that of F E to F H, which may be done by making
F H the greatest of three proportionals between
F E and F G; the crooked line B K D produced,
will pass through the point H. For if the strait
line B H be drawn, cutting C D in I, and H L be
drawn parallel to G D, and meeting C D produced
in L; it will be as F E to F G, so C L to C I, that
is, in quadruplicate proportion to that of F E to
F H, or of C D to C I. Wherefore if the line B K D
be produced according to its generation, it will
fall upon the point H.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The drawing of tangents to them.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span><a id='art17.5'></a>5. A strait line may be drawn so as to touch
the crooked line of the said figure in any point, in
this manner. Let it be required to draw a tangent
to the line B K D H (in <a href='#fig17.f4'>fig. 4</a>) in the point D. Let
the points B and D be connected, and drawing
D A equal and parallel to B C, let B and A be connected;
and because this figure is by construction
the third of three means, let there be taken in A B
three points, so, that by them the same A B be
divided into four equal parts; of which take three,
namely, A M, so that A B may be to A M, as the
figure B K D C is to its complement. I say, the
strait line M D will touch the figure in the point
given D. For let there be drawn anywhere between
A B and D C a parallel, as R Q, cutting the
strait line B D, the crooked line B K D, the strait
line M D, and the strait line A D, in the points
P, K, O and Q. R K will therefore, by construction,
be the least of three means in geometrical
proportion between R Q and R P. Wherefore (by
coroll. of <a href='#col13.28'>art. 28</a>, chapter <span class='fss'>XIII.</span>) R K will be less
than R O; and therefore M D will fall without the
figure. Now if M D be produced to N, F N will
be the greatest of three means in arithmetical proportion
between F E and F G; and F H will be the
greatest of three means in geometrical proportion
between the same F E and F G. Wherefore (by
the same coroll. of <a href='#col13.28'>art. 28</a>, chapter <span class='fss'>XIII.</span>) F H will
be less than F N; and therefore D N will fall without
the figure, and the strait line M N will touch
the same figure only in the point D.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>what proportion a strait-lined triangle has to the

how much the fourth three-sided figure of

of its complement A N I K, by the <a href='#art17.2'>second article</a>
of this chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, by the same article, as the proportion of
A B to A G, that is, of G M to G L, is to the proportion
of G F to G D, that is, by construction, of
G L to G N, so is the figure A B C D to its complement
A D C E.</p>

<p class='c001'>And by composition, as the proportion of G M
to G L, together with that of G L to G N, is to the
proportion of G M to G L, so is the complete figure
B E to the deficient figure A B C D.</p>

<p class='c001'>And by conversion, as the proportion of G M to
G L is to both the proportions of G M to G L and
of G L to G N, that is, to the proportion of G M to
G N, which is the proportion compounded of both,
so is the deficient figure A B C D to the complete
figure B E.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it was, as the proportion of G M to G L to
that of G M to G N, so the figure A N I B to its

:: A N I B. A N I K are proportionals. And by composition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>A B C D + B E. A B C D :: B K. A N I B

<p class='c001'>And by doubling the consequents, A B C D +

<div class='sidenote'>The transferring of certain properties of deficient figures described in a parallelogram to the proportions of spaces transmitted with several degrees of velocity.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art17.10'></a>10. From what has been said of deficient figures
described in a parallelogram, may be found out
what proportions spaces, transmitted with accelerated
motion in determined times, have to the
times themselves, according as the moved body is
accelerated in the several times with one or more
degrees of velocity.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig17.6'></a>For let the parallelogram A B C D, in the <a href='#fig17.f6'>6th figure</a>,
and in it the three-sided figure D E B C be
described; and let F G be drawn anywhere parallel
to the base, cutting the diagonal B D in H, and
the crooked line B E D in E; and let the proportion
of B C to B F be, for example, triplicate to
that of F G to F E; whereupon the figure D E B C
will be triple to its complement B E D A; and in
like manner, I E being drawn parallel to B C, the
three-sided figure E K B F will be triple to its complement
B K E I. Wherefore the parts of the deficient
figure cut off from the vertex by strait lines
parallel to the base, namely, D E B C and E K B F,
will be to one another as the parallelograms A C
and I F; that is, in proportion compounded of the
proportions of the altitudes and bases. Seeing
therefore the proportion of the altitude B C to the
altitude B F is triplicate to the proportion of the
base D C to the base F E, the figure D E B C to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>figure E K B F will be quadruplicate to the proportion
of the same D C to F E. And by the same
method, may be found out what proportion any of
the said three-sided figures has to any part of the
same, cut off from the vertex by a strait line parallel
to the base.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now as the said figures are understood to be
described by the continual decreasing of the base,
as of C D, for example, till it end in a point, as in
B; so also they may be understood to be described
by the continual increasing of a point, as of B, till
it acquire any magnitude, as that of C D.</p>

<p class='c001'>Suppose now the figure B E D C to be described
by the increasing of the point B to the magnitude
C D. Seeing therefore the proportion of B C to
B F is triplicate to that of C D to F E, the proportion
of F E to C D will, by conversion, as I shall
presently demonstrate, be triplicate to that B F to
B C. Wherefore if the strait line B C be taken for
the measure of the time in which the point B is
moved, the figure E K B F will represent the sum
of all the increasing velocities in the time B F; and
the figure D E B C will in like manner represent
the sum of all the increasing velocities in the time
B C. Seeing therefore the proportion of the figure
E K B F to the figure D E B C is compounded of
the proportions of altitude to altitude, and base to
base; and seeing the proportion of F E to C D is
triplicate to that of B F to B C; the proportion of
the figure E K B F to the figure D E B C will be
quadruplicate to that of B F to B C; that is, the
proportion of the sum of the velocities in the time
B F, to the sum of the velocities in the time B C,
will be quadruplicate to the proportion of B F to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>B C. Wherefore if a body be moved from B with
velocity so increasing, that the velocity acquired
in the time B F be to the velocity acquired in the
time B C in triplicate proportion to that of the
times themselves B F to B C, and the body be
carried to F in the time B F; the same body in the
time B C will be carried through a line equal to
the fifth proportional from B F in the continual
proportion of B F to B C. And by the same
manner of working, we may determine what spaces
are transmitted by velocities increasing according
to any other proportions.</p>

<p class='c001'>It remains that I demonstrate the proportion of
F E to C D to be triplicate to that of B F to B C.
Seeing therefore the proportion of C D, that is, of
F G to F E is subtriplicate to that of B C to B F;
the proportion of F G to F E will also be subtriplicate
to that of F G to F H. Wherefore the proportion
of F G to F H is triplicate to that of F G, that
is, of C D to F E. But in four continual proportionals,
of which the least is the first, the proportion
of the first to the fourth, (by the <a href='#art13.16'>16th article</a>
of chapter <span class='fss'>XIII.</span>), is subtriplicate to the proportion
of the third to the same fourth. Wherefore the
proportion of F H to G F is subtriplicate to that of
F E to C D; and therefore the proportion of F E
to C D is triplicate to that of F H to F G, that is, of
B F to B C; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may from hence be collected, that when the
velocity of a body is increased in the same proportion
with that of the times, the degrees of velocity
above one another proceed as numbers do in immediate
succession from unity, namely, as 1, 2, 3, 4,
&#38;c. And when the velocity is increased in proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>duplicate to that of the times, the degrees
proceed as numbers from unity, skipping one, as
1, 3, 5, 7, &#38;c. Lastly, when the proportions of
the velocities are triplicate to those of the times,
the progression of the degrees is as that of numbers
from unity, skipping two in every place, as
1, 4, 7, 10, &#38;c., and so of other proportions. For
geometrical proportionals, when they are taken in
every point, are the same with arithmetical proportionals.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of deficient figures described in a circle.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art17.11'></a>11. Moreover, it is to be noted that as in quantities,
which are made by any magnitudes decreasing,
the proportions of the figures to one another
are as the proportions of the altitudes to those of
the bases; so also it is in those, which are made
with motion decreasing, which motion is nothing
else but that power by which the described figures
are greater or less. And therefore in the description
of <i>Archimedes' spiral</i>, which is done by the
continual diminution of the semidiameter of a
circle in the same proportion in which the circumference
is diminished, the space, which is contained
within the semidiameter and the spiral
line, is a third part of the whole circle. For the
semidiameters of circles, inasmuch as circles are
understood to be made up of the aggregate of
them, are so many sectors; and therefore in the
description of a spiral, the sector which describes
it is diminished in duplicate proportions to the
diminutions of the circumference of the circle in
which it is inscribed; so that the complement of
the spiral, that is, that space in the circle which
is without the spiral line, is double to the space
within the spiral line. In the same manner, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>there be taken a mean proportional everywhere
between the semidiameter of the circle, which
contains the spiral, and that part of the semidiameter
which is within the same, there will be
made another figure, which will be half the circle.
And to conclude, this rule serves for all such
spaces as may be described by a line or superficies
decreasing either in magnitude of power; so that
if the proportions, in which they decrease, be
commensurable to the proportions of the times in
which they decrease, the magnitudes of the figures
they describe will be known.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The proposition demonstrated in art. 2 confirmed from the elements of philosophy.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art17.12'></a>12. The truth of that proposition, which I demonstrated
in <a href='#art17.2'>art. 2</a>, which is the foundation of all
that has been said concerning deficient figures,
may be derived from the elements of philosophy,
as having its original in this; <i>that all equality
and inequality between two effects, that is, all
proportion, proceeds from, and is determined by,
the equal and unequal causes of those effects, or
from the proportion which the causes, concurring
to one effect, have to the causes which concur to
the producing of the other effect</i>; and that therefore
the proportions of quantities are the same
with the proportions of their causes. Seeing,
therefore, two deficient figures, of which one is
the complement of the other, are made, one by
motion decreasing in a certain time and proportion,
the other by the loss of motion in the same time;
the causes, which make and determine the quantities
of both the figures, so that they can be no
other than they are, differ only in this, that the
proportions by which the quantity which generates
the figure proceeds in describing of the same, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>is, the proportions of the remainders of all the
times and altitudes, may be other proportions than
those by which the same generating quantity decreases
in making the complement of that figure,
that is, the proportions of the quantity which generates
the figure continually diminished. Wherefore,
as the proportion of the times in which motion is
lost, is to that of the decreasing quantities by
which the deficient figure is generated, so will the
defect or complement be to the figure itself which
is generated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An unusual way of reasoning concerning the equality between the superficies of a portion of a sphere and a circle.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art17.13'></a>13. There are also other quantities which are
determinable from the knowledge of their causes,
namely, from the comparison of the motions by
which they are made; and that more easily than
from the common elements of geometry. For
example, that the superficies of any portion of a
sphere is equal to that circle, whose radius is a
strait line drawn from the pole of the portion to
the circumference of its base, I may demonstrate
in this manner. <a id='fig17.7'></a>Let B A C (in <a href='#fig17.f7'>fig. 7</a>) be a portion
of a sphere, whose axis is A E, and whose base is
B C; and let A B be the strait line drawn from
the pole A to the base in B; and let A D, equal to
A B, touch the great circle B A C in the pole A.
It is to be proved that the circle made by the
radius A D is equal to the superficies of the portion
B A C. Let the plain A E B D be understood to
make a revolution about the axis A E; and it is
manifest that by the strait line A D a circle will be
described; and by the arch A B the superficies of
a portion of a sphere; and lastly, by the subtense
A B the superficies of a right cone. Now seeing
both the strait line A B and the arch A B make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>one and the same revolution, and both of them
have the same extreme points A and B, the cause
why the spherical superficies, which is made by
the arch, is greater than the conical superficies,
which is made by the subtense, is, that A B the
arch is greater than A B the subtense; and the
cause why it is greater consists in this, that
although they be both drawn from A to B, yet the
subtense is drawn strait, but the arch angularly,
namely, according to that angle which the arch
makes with the subtense, which angle is equal to
the angle D A B (for an angle of contingence adds
nothing to an angle of a segment, as has been shown
in chapter <span class='fss'>XIV</span>, <a href='#art14.16'>article 16</a>.) Wherefore the magnitude
of the angle D A B is the cause why the
superficies of the portion, described by the arch
A B, is greater than the superficies of the right
cone described by the subtense A B.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, the cause why the circle described by
the tangent A D is greater than the superficies of
the right cone described by the subtense A B (notwithstanding
that the tangent and the subtense
are equal, and both moved round in the same
time) is this, that A D stands at right angles to
the axis, but A B obliquely; which obliquity consists
in the same angle D A B. Seeing therefore
the quantity of the angle D A B is that which
makes the excess both of the superficies of the
portion, and of the circle made by the radius A D,
above the superficies of the right cone described
by the subtense A B; it follows, that both the
superficies of the portion and that of the circle
do equally exceed the superficies of the cone.
Wherefore the circle made by A D or A B, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>the spherical superficies made by the arch A B, are
equal to one another; which was to be proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How from the description of deficient figures in a parallelogram, any number of mean proportionals may be found out between two given strait lines.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art17.14'></a>14. If these deficient figures, which I have described
in a parallelogram, were capable of exact
description, then any number of mean proportionals
might be found out between two strait lines
given. <a id='fig17.8'></a>For example, in the parallelogram A B C D,
(in <a href='#fig17.f8'>figure 8</a>) let the three-sided figure of two means
be described (which many call a <em>cubical parabola</em>);
and let R and S be two given strait lines; between
which, if it be required to find two mean proportionals,
it may be done thus. Let it be as R to S,
so B C to B F; and let F E be drawn parallel to
B A, and cut the crooked line in E; then through
E let G H be drawn parallel and equal to the strait
line A D, and cut the diagonal B D in I; for thus
we have G I the greatest of two means between
G H and G E, as appears by the description of the
figure in <a href='#art17.4'>article 4</a>. Wherefore, if it be as G H to
G I, so R to another line, T, that T will be the
greatest of two means between R and S. And
therefore if <a id='corr267.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='it it'>it</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_267.22'><ins class='correction' title='it it'>it</ins></a></span> be again as R to T, so T to another
line, X, that will be done which was required.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the same manner, four mean proportionals
may be found out, by the description of a three-sided
figure of four means; and so any other number
of means, &#38;c.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>To find a strait line equal to the crooked line of a semiparabola.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art18.1'></a>1. A parabola being given, to find a strait line
equal to the crooked line of the semiparabola.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig18.1'></a>Let the parabolical line given be A B C (in
<a href='#fig18.f1'>figure 1</a>), and the diameter found be A D, and the
base drawn D C; and the parallelogram A D C E
being completed, draw the strait line A C. Then
dividing A D into two equal parts in F, draw F H
equal and parallel to D C, cutting A C in K, and
the parabolical line in O; and between F H and
F O take a mean proportional F P, and draw A O,
A P and P C. I say that the two lines A P and
P C, taken together as one line, are equal to the
parabolical line A B O C.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the line A B O C being a parabolical line, is
generated by the concourse of two motions, one
uniform from A to E, the other in the same time
uniformly accelerated from rest in A to D. And
because the motion from A to E is uniform, A E
may represent the times of both those motions
from the beginning to the end. Let therefore
A E be the time; and consequently the lines ordinately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>applied in the semiparabola will design the
parts of time wherein the body, that describeth
the line A B O C, is in every point of the same; so
that as at the end of the time A E or D C it is in C,
so at the end of the time F O it will be in O. And
because the velocity in A D is increased uniformly,
that is, in the same proportion with the time, the
same lines ordinately applied in the semiparabola
will design also the continual augmentation of the
impetus, till it be at the greatest, designed by the
base D C. Therefore supposing uniform motion
in the line A F, in the time F K the body in A by
the concourse of the two uniform motions in A F
and F K will be moved uniformly in the line A K;
and K O will be the increase of the impetus or
swiftness gained in the time F K; and the line
A O will be uniformly described by the concourse
of the two uniform motions in A F and F O in the
time F O. From O draw O L parallel to E C,
cutting A C in L; and draw L N parallel to D C,
cutting E C in N, and the parabolical line in M;
and produce it on the other side to A D in I; and
I N, I M and I L will be, by the construction of a
parabola, in continual proportion, and equal to
the three lines F H, F P and F O; and a strait
line parallel to E C passing through M will fall on
P; and therefore O P will be the increase of impetus
gained in the time F O or I L. Lastly, produce
P M to C D in Q; and Q C or M N or P H will
be the increase of impetus proportional to the time
F P or I M or D Q. Suppose now uniform motion
from H to C in the time P H. Seeing therefore in
the time F P with uniform motion and the impetus
increased in proportion to the times, is described
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>the straight line A P; and in the rest of the time
and impetus, namely, P H, is described the line
C P uniformly; it followeth that the whole line
A P C is described with the whole impetus, and in
the same time wherewith is described the parabolical
line A B C; and therefore the line A P C,
made of the two strait lines A P and P C, is equal
to the parabolical line A B C; which was to be
proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>To find a strait line equal to the crooked line of the first semiparabolaster or to the crooked line of any other of the deficient figures of the table of <a href='#art17.3'>art. 3</a> of the preceding chapter.</div>

of the first semiparabolaster.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>[Discussion of <a href='#fig18.f2'>Figure 18.2</a>]</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig18.2'></a>Let A B C be the crooked line of the first semiparabolaster;
A D the diameter; D C the base;
and let the parallelogram completed be A D C E,
whose diagonal is A C. Divide the diameter into
two equal parts in F, and draw F H equal and
parallel to D C, cutting A C in K, the crooked line
in O, and E C in H. Then draw O L parallel to
E C, cutting A C in L; and draw L N parallel
to the base D C, cutting the crooked line in M,
and the strait line E C in N; and produce it on
the other side to A D in I. Lastly, through the
point M draw P M Q parallel and equal to H C,
cutting F H in P; and join C P, A P and A O.
I say, the two strait lines A P and P C are equal to
the crooked line A B O C.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the line A B O C, being the crooked line of
the first semiparabolaster, is generated by the
concourse of two motions, one uniform from A to
E, the other in the same time accelerated from
rest in A to D, so as that the impetus increaseth
in proportion perpetually triplicate to that of the
increase of the time, or which is all one, the
lengths transmitted are in proportion triplicate to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>that of the times of their transmission; for as the
impetus or quicknesses increase, so the lengths
transmitted increase also. And because the motion
from A to E is uniform, the line A E may
serve to represent the time, and consequently the
lines, ordinately drawn in the semiparabolaster,
will design the parts of time wherein the body,
beginning from rest in A, describeth by its
motion the crooked line A B O C. And because
D C, which represents the greatest acquired impetus,
is equal to A E, the same ordinate lines will
represent the several augmentations of the impetus
increasing from rest in A. Therefore, supposing
uniform motion from A to F, in the time F K there
will be described, by the concourse of the two
uniform motions A F and F K, the line A K uniformly,
and K O will be the increase of impetus in
the time F K; and by the concourse of the two
uniform motions in A F and F O will be described
the line A O uniformly. Through the point L
draw the strait line L M N parallel to D C, cutting
the strait line A D in I, the crooked line A B C in
M, and the strait line E C in N; and through the
point M the strait line P M Q parallel and equal to
H C, cutting D C in Q and F H in P. By the
concourse therefore of the two uniform motions in
A F and F P in the time F P will be uniformly
described the strait line A P; and L M or O P
will be the increase of impetus to be added for the
time F O. And because the proportion of I N to
I L is triplicate to the proportion of I N to I M,
the proportion of F H to F O will also be triplicate
to the proportion of F H to F P; and the
proportional impetus gained in the time F P is P H.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>So that F H being equal to D C, which designed
the whole impetus acquired by the acceleration,
there is no more increase of impetus to be computed.
Now in the time P H suppose an uniform
motion from H to C; and by the two uniform motions
in C H and H P will be described uniformly
the strait line P C. Seeing therefore the two strait
lines A P and P C are described in the time A E
with the same increase of impetus, wherewith the
crooked line A B O C is described in the same
time A E, that is, seeing the line A P C and the
line A B O C are transmitted by the same body in
the same time and with equal velocities, the lines
themselves are equal; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the same method (if any of the semiparabolasters
in the table of <a href='#art17.3'>art. 3</a> of the precedent
chapter be exhibited) may be found a strait line
equal to the crooked line thereof, namely, by
dividing the diameter into two equal parts, and
proceeding as before. Yet no man hitherto hath
compared any crooked with any strait line, though
many geometricians of every age have endeavoured
it. But the cause, why they have not done it,
may be this, that there being in Euclid no definition
of equality, nor any mark by which to judge
of it besides congruity (which is the 8th axiom of
the first Book of his Elements) a thing of no use
at all in the comparing of strait and crooked; and
others after Euclid (except Archimedes and Apollonius,
and in our time Bonaventura) thinking the
industry of the ancients had reached to all that
was to be done in geometry, thought also, that
all that could be propounded was either to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>deduced from what they had written, or else that
it was not at all to be done: it was therefore disputed
by some of those ancients themselves, whether
there might be any equality at all between
crooked and strait lines; which question Archimedes,
who assumed that some strait line was
equal to the circumference of a circle, seems to
have despised, as he had reason. And there is a
late writer that granteth that between a strait
and a crooked line there is equality; but now,
says he, since the fall of Adam, without the special
assistance of Divine Grace it is not to be
found.</p>

the lines reflected from them shall also be parallel.—<a href='#art19.2'>2.</a> If two

the lines reflected from them, if they be drawn out the other
way, will meet in an angle equal to the angle made by the lines
of incidence.—<a href='#art19.3'>3.</a> If two strait parallel lines, drawn not oppositely,
but from the same parts, fall upon the circumference of
a circle, the lines reflected from them, if produced they meet
within the circle, will make an angle double to that which is
made by two strait lines drawn from the centre to the points of
incidence.—<a href='#art19.4'>4.</a> If two strait lines drawn from the same point
without a circle fall upon the circumference, and the lines
reflected from them being produced meet within the circle,
they will make an angle equal to twice that angle, which is
made by two strait lines drawn from the centre to the points of
incidence, together with the angle which the incident lines
themselves make.—<a href='#art19.5'>5.</a> If two strait lines drawn from one point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>fall upon the concave circumference of a circle, and the angle
they make be less than twice the angle at the centre, the lines
reflected from them and meeting within the circle will make an
angle, which being added to the angle of the incident lines will
be equal to twice the angle at the centre.—<a href='#art19.6'>6.</a> If through any
one point two unequal chords be drawn cutting one another,
and the centre of the circle be not placed between them, and
the lines reflected from them concur wheresoever, there cannot
through the point, through which the two former lines
were drawn, be drawn any other strait line whose reflected
line shall pass through the common point of the two former
lines reflected.—<a href='#art19.7'>7.</a> In equal chords the same is not true.—<a href='#art19.8'>8.</a>
Two points being given in the circumference of a circle, to
draw two strait lines to them, so that their reflected lines may
contain any angle given.—<a href='#art19.9'>9.</a> If a strait line falling upon the
circumference of a circle be produced till it reach the semidiameter,
and that part of it, which is intercepted between
the circumference and the semidiameter, be equal to that part
of the semidiameter which is between the point of concourse
and the centre, the reflected line will be parallel to the semidiameter.—<a href='#art19.10'>10.</a>
If from a point within a circle, two strait lines
be drawn to the circumference, and their reflected lines meet
in the circumference of the same circle, the angle made by the
reflected lines will be a third part of the angle made by the incident
lines.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Angles of incidence and reflection.</div>

<p class='c001'>Whether a body falling upon the superficies of
another body and being reflected from it, do make
equal angles at that superficies, it belongs not to
this place to dispute, being a knowledge which
depends upon the natural causes of reflection; of
which hitherto nothing has been said, but shall be
spoken of hereafter.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this place, therefore, let it be supposed that
the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
reflection; that our present search may be applied,
not to the finding out of the causes, but
some consequences of the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>I call an <em>angle of incidence</em>, that which is made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>between a strait line and another line, strait or
crooked, upon which it falls, and which I call the
<em>line reflecting</em>; and an <em>angle of reflection</em> equal
to it, that which is made at the same point between
the strait line which is reflected and the line
reflecting.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If two strait lines falling upon another strait line be parallel, the lines reflected from them shall also be parallel.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art19.1'></a>1. If two strait lines, which fall upon another
strait line, be parallel, their reflected lines shall be
also parallel.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig19.1'></a>Let the two strait lines A B and C D (in <a href='#fig19.f1'>fig. 1</a>),
which fall upon the strait line E F, at the points
B and D, be parallel; and let the lines reflected
from them be B G and D H. I say, B G and D H
are also parallel.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the angles A B E and C D E are equal by
reason of the parallelism of A B and C D; and the
angles G B F and H D F are equal to them by supposition;
for the lines B G and D H are reflected
from the lines A B and C D. Wherefore B G and
D H are parallel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If two strait lines drawn from one point fall upon another strait line, the lines reflected from them, if they be drawn out the other way, will meet in an angle equal to the angle made by the lines of incidence.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art19.2'></a>2. If two strait lines drawn from the same
point fall upon another strait line, the lines reflected
from them, if they be drawn out the other
way, will meet in an angle equal to the angle of the
incident lines.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig19.2'></a>From the point A (in <a href='#fig19.2'>fig. 2</a>) let the two strait
lines A B and A D be drawn; and let them fall
upon the strait line E K at the points B and D;
and let the lines B I and D G be reflected from
them. I say, I B and G D do converge, and that if
they be produced on the other side of the line E K,
they shall meet, as in F; and that the angle B F D
shall be equal to the angle B A D.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the angle of reflection I B K is equal to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>angle of incidence A B E; and to the angle I B K
its vertical angle E B F is equal; and therefore
the angle A B E is equal to the angle E B F.
Again, the angle A D E is equal to the angle of
reflection G D K, that is, to its vertical angle
E D F; and therefore the two angles A B D and
A D B of the triangle A B D are one by one equal
to the two angles F B D and F D B of the triangle
F B D; wherefore also the third angle B A D is
equal to the third angle B F D; which was to be
proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor19.2.1'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>I.</span> If the strait line A F be drawn, it will
be perpendicular to the strait line E K. For both
the angles at E will be equal, by reason of the
equality of the two angles A B E and F B E, and
of the two sides A B and F B.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor19.2.2'></a>Coroll. <span class='fss'>II.</span> If upon any point between B and D
there fall a strait line, as A C, whose reflected line is
C H, this also produced beyond C, will fall upon F;
which is evident by the demonstration above.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If two strait parallel lines, drawn not oppositely, but from the same parts, fall upon the circumference of a circle, the lines reflected from them, if produced they meet within the circle, will make an angle double to that which is made by two strait lines drawn from the centre to the points of incidence.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art19.3'></a>3. If from two points taken without a circle,
two strait parallel lines, drawn not oppositely, but
from the same parts, fall upon the circumference;
the lines reflected from them, if produced they
meet within the circle, will make an angle double
to that which is made by two strait lines drawn
from the centre to the points of incidence.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig19.3'></a>Let the two strait parallels A B and D C (in
<a href='#fig19.f3'>fig. 3</a>) fall upon the circumference B C at the
points B and C; and let the centre of the circle be
E; and let A B reflected be B F, and D C reflected
be C G; and let the lines F B and G C produced
meet within the circle in H; and let E B and E C
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>be connected. I say the angle F H G is double to
the angle B E C.</p>

<p class='c001'>For seeing A B and D C are parallels, and E B
cuts A B in B, the same E B produced will cut
D C somewhere; let it cut it in D; and let D C
be produced howsoever to I, and let the intersection
of D C and B F be at K. The angle therefore
I C H, being external to the triangle C K H, will
be equal to the two opposite angles C K H and
C H K. Again, I C E being external to the triangle
C D E, is equal to the two angles at D and E.
Wherefore the angle I C H, being double to the
angle I C E, is equal to the angles at D and E
twice taken; and therefore the two angles C K H
and C H K are equal to the two angles at D and E
twice taken. But the angle C K H is equal to the
angles D and A B D, that is, D twice taken; for
A B and D C being parallels, the altern angles D
and A B D are equal. Wherefore C H K, that is
the angle F H G is also equal to the angle at E
twice taken; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. If from two points taken within a circle
two strait parallels fall upon the circumference,
the lines reflected from them shall meet in an
angle, double to that which is made by two strait
lines drawn from the centre to the points of
incidence. For the parallels A B and I C falling
upon the points B and C, are reflected in the lines
B H and C H, and make the angle at H double to
the angle at E, as was but now demonstrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If two strait lines drawn from the same point without a circle fall upon the circumference, and the lines reflected from them being produced meet within<br>the circle, they will make an angle equal to twice that angle, which is made by two strait lines drawn from the centre to the points of incidence, together with the angle which the incident lines themselves make.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art19.4'></a>4. If two strait lines drawn from the same point
without a circle fall upon the circumference, and
the lines reflected from them being produced meet
within the circle, they will make an angle equal to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>twice that angle, which is made by two strait lines
drawn from the centre to the points of incidence,
together with the angle which the incident lines
themselves make.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig19.4'></a>Let the two strait lines A B and A C (in <a href='#fig19.f4'>fig. 4</a>)
be drawn from the point A to the circumference
of the circle, whose centre is D; and let the lines
reflected from them be B E and C G, and, being
produced, make within the circle the angle H;
also let the two strait lines D B and D C be drawn
from the centre D to the points of incidence B
and C. I say, the angle H is equal to twice the
angle at D together with the angle at A.</p>

<p class='c001'>For let A C be produced howsoever to I. Therefore
the angle I C H, which is external to the
triangle C K H, will be equal to the two angles
C K H and C H K. Again, the angle I C D, which
is external to the triangle C L D, will be equal to
the two angles C L D and C D L. But the angle
I C H is double to the angle I C D, and is therefore
equal to the angles C L D and C D L twice taken.
Wherefore the angles C K H and C H K are equal
to the angles C L D and C D L twice taken. But
the angle C L D, being external to the triangle
A L B, is equal to the two angles L A B and L B A;
and consequently C L D twice taken is equal to
L A B and L B A twice taken. Wherefore C K H
and C H K are equal to the angle C D L together
with L A B and L B A twice taken. Also the
angle C K H is equal to the angle L A B once and
A B K, that is, L B A twice taken. Wherefore
the angle C H K is equal to the remaining angle
C D L, that is, to the angle at D, twice taken, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>the angle L A B, that is, the angle at A, once
taken; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor19.4.1'></a>Coroll. If two strait converging lines, as I C and
M B, fall upon the concave circumference of a
circle, their reflected lines, as C H and B H, will
meet in the angle H, equal to twice the angle D,
together with the angle at A made by the incident
lines produced. Or, if the incident lines be H B
and I C, whose reflected lines C H and B M meet
in the point N, the angle C N B will be equal to
twice the angle D, together with the angle C K H
made by the lines of incidence. For the angle
C N B is equal to the angle H, that is, to twice
the angle D, together with the two angles A, and
N B H, that is, K B A. But the angles K B A
and A are equal to the angle C K H. Wherefore
the angle C N B is equal to twice the angle D,
together with the angle C K H made by the lines
of incidence I C and H B produced to K.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If two strait lines drawn from one point fall upon the concave circumference of a circle, and the angle they make be less than twice the angle at the centre, the lines reflected from them and meeting within the circle will make an angle, which being added to the angle of the incident lines will be equal to twice the angle at the centre.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art19.5'></a>5. If two strait lines drawn from one point fall
upon the concave circumference of a circle, and
the angle they make be less than twice the angle
at the centre, the lines reflected from them and
meeting within the circle will make an angle,
which being added to the angle of the incident
lines, will be equal to twice the angle at the centre.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig19.5'></a>Let the two lines A B and A C (in <a href='#fig19.f5'>fig. 5</a>), drawn
from the point A, fall upon the concave circumference
of the circle whose centre is D; and let
their reflected lines B E and C E meet in the point
E; also let the angle A be less than twice the
angle D. I say, the angles A and E together
taken are equal to twice the angle D.</p>

<p class='c001'>For let the strait lines A B and E C cut the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>strait lines D C and D B in the points G and H;
and the angle B H C will be equal to the two
angles E B H and E; also the same angle B H C
will be equal to the two angles D and D C H; and
in like manner the angle B G C will be equal to
the two angles A C D and A, and the same angle
B G C will be also equal to the two angles D B G
and D. Wherefore the four angles E B H, E,
A C D and A, are equal to the four angles D, D C H,
D B G and D. If, therefore, equals be taken away
on both sides, namely, on one side A C D and
E B H, and on the other side D C H and D B G,
(for the angle E B H is equal to the angle D B G,
and the angle A C D equal to the angle D C H),
the remainders on both sides will be equal, namely,
on one side the angles A and E, and on the other
the angle D twice taken. Wherefore the angles
A and E are equal to twice the angle D.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor19.5.1'></a>Coroll. If the angle A be greater than twice the
angle D, their reflected lines will diverge. For, by
the corollary of the third proposition, if the angle
A be equal to twice the angle D, the reflected lines
B E and C E will be parallel; and if it be less,
they will concur, as has now been demonstrated.
And therefore, if it be greater, the reflected lines
B E and C E will diverge, and consequently, if
they be produced the other way, they will concur
and make an angle equal to the excess of the angle
A above twice the angle D; as is evident by <a href='#art19.4'>art. 4</a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If through any one point two unequal chords be drawn cutting one another, and the centre of the circle be not placed between them, and the lines reflected from them concur wheresoever, there cannot through the point, through which the two former lines were drawn, be drawn any other strait line whose reflected line shall pass through the common point of the two former lines reflected.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art19.6'></a>6. If through any one point two unequal chords
be drawn cutting one another, either within the
circle, or, if they be produced, without it, and the
centre of the circle be not placed between them,
and the lines reflected from them concur wheresoever;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>there cannot, through the point through
which the former lines were drawn, be drawn
another strait line, whose reflected line shall pass
through the point where the two former reflected
lines concur.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig19.6'></a>Let any two unequal chords, as B K and C H
(in <a href='#fig19.f6'>fig. 6</a>), be drawn through the point A in the
circle B C; and let their reflected lines B D and
C E meet in F; and let the centre not be between
A B and A C; and from the point A let any other
strait line, as A G, be drawn to the circumference
between B and C. I say, G N, which passes
through the point F, where the reflected lines B D
and C E meet, will not be the reflected line of A G.</p>

<p class='c001'>For let the arch B L be taken equal to the arch
B G, and the strait line B M equal to the strait
line B A; and L M being drawn, let it be produced
to the circumference in O. Seeing therefore B A
and B M are equal, and the arch B L equal to the
arch B G, and the angle M B L equal to the angle
A B G, A G and M L will also be equal, and, producing
G A to the circumference in I, the whole
lines L O and G I will in like manner be equal.
But L O is greater than G F N, as shall presently
be demonstrated; and therefore also G I is greater
than G N. Wherefore the angles N G C and I G B
are not equal. Wherefore the line G F N is not
reflected from the line of incidence A G, and consequently
no other strait line, besides A B and
A C, which is drawn through the point A, and
falls upon the circumference B C, can be reflected
to the point F; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>It remains that I prove L O to be greater than
G N; which I shall do in this manner. L O and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>G N cut one another in P; and P L is greater than
P G. Seeing now L P. P G :: P N. P O are proportionals,
therefore the two extremes L P and P O
together taken, that is L O, are greater than P G
and P N together taken, that is, G N; which remained
to be proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In equal chords the same is not true.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art19.7'></a>7. But if two equal chords be drawn through one
point within a circle, and the lines reflected from
them meet in another point, then another strait line
may be drawn between them through the former
point, whose reflected line shall pass through the
latter point.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig19.7'></a>Let the two equal chords B C and E D (in the
<a href='#fig19.f7'>7th figure</a>) cut one another in the point A within
the circle B C D; and let their reflected lines C H
and D I meet in the point F. Then dividing the
arch C D equally in G, let the two chords G K and
G L be drawn through the points A and F. I say,
G L will be the line reflected from the chord K G.
For the four chords B C, C H, E D and D I are by
supposition all equal to one another; and therefore
the arch B C H is equal to the arch E D I; as also
the angle B C H to the angle E D I; and the angle
A M C to its verticle angle F M D; and the strait
line D M to the strait line G M; and, in like manner,
the strait line A C to the strait line F D; and
the chords C G and G D being drawn, will also be
equal; and also the angles F D G and A C G, in the
equal segments G D I and G C B. Wherefore the
strait lines F G and A G are equal; and, therefore,
the angle F G D is equal to the angle A G C, that
is, the angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection.
Wherefore the line G L is reflected from
the incident line C G; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span><a id='cor19.7.1'></a>Coroll. By the very sight of the figure it is manifest,

lines, so that their reflected lines may, first,
be parallel.</p>

line D C, with its reflected line C F; and let the
angle E C D be made double to the angle A; and
let H B be drawn parallel to E C, and produced
till it meet with D C produced in I. Lastly, producing
A B indefinitely to K, let G B be drawn so
that the angle G B K may be equal to the angle
H B K, and then G B will be the reflected line of
the incident line H B. I say, D C and H B are two
incident lines, whose reflected lines C F and B G
are parallel.</p>

<p class='c001'>For seeing the angle E C D is double to the angle
B A C, the angle H I C is also, by reason of the
parallels E C and H I, double to the same B A C;
therefore also F C and G B, namely, the lines reflected
from the incident lines D C and H B, are
parallel. Wherefore the first thing required is
done.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, let it be required to draw to the points
B and C two strait lines of incidence, so that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>lines reflected from them may contain the given

<p class='c001'>To the angle E C D made at the point C, let there
be added on one side the angle D C L equal to half
Z, and on the other side the angle E C M equal to
the angle D C L; and let the strait line B N be
drawn parallel to the strait line C M; and let the
angle K B O be made equal to the angle N B K;
which being done, B O will be the line of reflection
from the line of incidence N B. Lastly, from the
incident line L C, let the reflected line C O be
drawn, cutting B O at O, and making the angle
C O B. I say, the angle C O B is equal to the
angle Z.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let N B be produced till it meet with the strait
line L C produced in P. Seeing, therefore, the
angle L C M is, by construction, equal to twice the
angle B A C, together with the angle Z; the angle
N P L, which is equal to L C M by reason of the
parallels N P and M C, will also be equal to twice
the same angle B A C, together with the angle Z.
And seeing the two strait lines O C and O B fall
from the point O upon the points C and B; and
their reflected lines L C and N B meet in the point
P; the angle N P L will be equal to twice the angle
B A C together with the angle C O B. But I have
already proved the angle N P L to be equal to twice
the angle B A C together with the angle Z. Therefore
the angle C O B is equal to the angle Z; wherefore,
two points in the circumference of a circle
being given, I have drawn, &#38;c.; which was to be done.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if it be required to draw the incident lines
from a point within the circle, so that the lines reflected
from them may contain an angle equal to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>the angle Z, the same method is to be used, saving
that in this case the angle Z is not to be added to
twice the angle B A C, but to be taken from it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If a strait line falling upon the circumference of a circle be produced till it reach the semidiameter, and that part of it, which is intercepted between the circumference and the semidiameter, be equal to that part of the semidiameter which is between the point of concourse and the centre, the reflected line will be parallel to the semidiameter.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art19.9'></a>9. If a strait line, falling upon the circumference
of a circle, be produced till it reach the semidiameter,
and that part of it which is intercepted between
the circumference and the semidiameter be
equal to that part of the semidiameter which is
between the point of concourse and the centre, the
reflected line will be parallel to the semidiameter.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig19.9'></a>Let any line A B (in the <a href='#fig19.f9'>9th figure</a>) be the semidiameter
of the circle whose centre is A; and upon
the circumference B D let the strait line C D fall,
and be produced till it cut A B in E, so that E D
and E A may be equal; and from the incident line
C D let the line D F be reflected. I say, A B and
D F will be parallel.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let A G be drawn through the point D. Seeing,
therefore, E D and E A are equal, the angles E D A
and E A D will also be equal. But the angles F D G
and E D A are equal; for each of them is half the
angle E D H or F D C. Wherefore the angles F D G
and E A D are equal; and consequently D F and
A B are parallel; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='cor19.9.1'></a>Coroll. If E A be greater then E D, then D F
and A B being produced will concur; but if E A
be less than E D, then B A and D H being produced
will concur.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If from a point within a circle two strait lines be drawn to the circumference, and their reflected lines meet in the circumference of the same circle, the angle made by the reflected lines will be a third part of the angle made by the incident lines.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art19.10'></a>10. If from a point within a circle two strait
lines be drawn to the circumference, and their reflected
lines meet in the circumference of the same
circle, the angle made by the lines of reflection will
be a third part of the angle made by the lines of
incidence.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span><a id='fig19.10'></a>From the point B (in the <a href='#fig19.10'>10th figure</a>) taken
within the circle whose centre is A, let the two
strait lines B C and B D be drawn to the circumference;
and let their reflected lines C E and D E
meet in the circumference of the same circle at the
point E. I say, the angle C E D will be a third
part of the angle C B D.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let A C and A D be drawn. Seeing, therefore,
the angles C E D and C B D together taken are
equal to twice the angle C A D (as has been demonstrated
in the <a href='#art19.5'>5th article</a>); and the angle
C A D twice taken is quadruple to the angle C E D;
the angles C E D and C B D together taken will
also be equal to the angle C E D four times taken;
and therefore if the angle C E D be taken away on
both sides, there will remain the angle C B D on
one side, equal to the angle C E D thrice taken on
the other side; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. Therefore a point being given within a
circle, there may be drawn two lines from it to the
circumference, so as their reflected lines may meet
in the circumference. For it is but trisecting the

shown in the following chapter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The dimension of a circle never determined in numbers by Archimedes and others.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art20.1'></a>1. In the comparing of an arch of a circle with a
strait line, many and great geometricians, even
from the most ancient times, have exercised their
wits; and more had done the same, if they had
not seen their pains, though undertaken for the
common good, if not brought to perfection, vilified
by those that envy the praises of other men.
Amongst those ancient writers whose works are
come to our hands, Archimedes was the first that
brought the length of the perimeter of a circle
within the limits of numbers very little differing
from the truth; demonstrating the same to be
less than three diameters and a seventh part, but
greater than three diameters and ten seventy-one
parts of the diameter. So that supposing the
radius to consist of 10,000,000 equal parts, the
arch of a quadrant will be between 15,714,285
and 15,704,225 of the same parts. In our times,
Ludovicus Van Cullen and Willebrordus Snellius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>with joint endeavour, have come yet nearer to
the truth; and pronounced from true principles,
that the arch of a quadrant, putting, as before,
10,000,000 for radius, differs not one whole unity
from the number 15,707,963; which, if they had
exhibited their arithmetical operations, and no
man had discovered any error in that long work
of theirs, had been demonstrated by them. This
is the furthest progress that has been made by the
way of numbers; and they that have proceeded
thus far deserve the praise of industry. Nevertheless,
if we consider the benefit, which is the
scope at which all speculation should aim, the
improvement they have made has been little or
none. For any ordinary man may much sooner
and more accurately find a strait line equal to the
perimeter of a circle, and consequently square the
circle, by winding a small thread about a given
cylinder, than any geometrician shall do the same
by dividing the radius into 10,000,000 equal parts.
But though the length of the circumference were
exactly set out, either by numbers, or mechanically,
or only by chance, yet this would contribute no
help at all towards the section of angles, unless
happily these two problems, <em>to divide a given
angle according to any proportion assigned</em>, and
<em>to find a strait line equal to the arch of a circle</em>,
were reciprocal, and followed one another. Seeing
therefore the benefit proceeding from the knowledge
of the length of the arch of a quadrant
consists in this, that we may thereby divide an
angle according to any proportion, either accurately,
or at least accurately enough for common
use; and seeing this cannot be done by arithmetic, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>thought fit to attempt the same by geometry,
and in this chapter to make trial whether it might
not be performed by the drawing of strait and
circular lines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first attempt for the finding out of the dimension of a circle by lines.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig20.1'></a><a id='art20.2'></a>2. Let the square A B C D (in the <a href='#fig20.f1'>first figure</a>)
be described; and with the radii A B, B C, and
D C, the three arches B D, C A, and A C; of which
let the two B D and C A cut one another in E, and
the two B D and A C in F. The diagonals therefore
B D and A C being drawn will cut one another
in the centre of the square G, and the two arches
B D and C A in two equal parts in H and Y; and
the arch B H D will be trisected in F and E.
Through the centre G let the two strait lines K G L
and M G N be drawn parallel and equal to the
sides of the square A B and A D, cutting the four
sides of the same square in the points K, L, M,
and N; which being done, K L will pass through
F, and M N through E. Then let O P be drawn
parallel and equal to the side B C, cutting the
arch B F D in F, and the sides A B and D C in O
and P. Therefore O F will be the sine of the arch
B F, which is an arch of 30 degrees; and the
same O F will be equal to half the radius. Lastly,
dividing the arch B F in the middle in Q, let R Q,
the sine of the arch B Q, be drawn and produced
to S, so that Q S be equal to R Q, and consequently
R S be equal to the chord of the arch B F; and
let F S be drawn and produced to T in the side
B C. I say, the strait line B T is equal to the
arch B F; and consequently that B V, the triple of
B T, is equal to the arch of the quadrant B F E D.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let T F be produced till it meet the side B A
produced in X; and dividing O F in the middle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>in Z, let Q Z be drawn and produced till it meet
with the side B A produced. Seeing therefore the
strait lines R S and O F are parallel, and divided
in the midst in Q and Z, Q Z produced will fall
upon X, and X Z Q produced to the side B C will
cut B T in the midst in α.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the strait line F Z, the fourth part of the
radius A B, let the equilateral triangle <i>a</i> Z F be
constituted; and upon the centre <i>a</i>, with the
radius <i>a</i> Z, let the arch Z F be drawn; which arch
Z F will therefore be equal to the arch Q F, the
half of the arch B F. Again, let the strait line
Z O be cut in the midst in <i>b</i>, and the strait line
<i>b</i> O in the midst in <i>c</i>; and let the bisection be
continued in this manner till the last part O <i>c</i> be
the least that can possibly be taken; and upon it,
and all the rest of the parts equal to it into which
the strait line O F may be cut, let so many equilateral
triangles be understood to be constituted;
of which let the last be <i>d</i> O <i>c</i>. If, therefore, upon
the centre <i>d</i>, with the radius <i>d</i> O, be drawn the
arch O <i>c</i>, and upon the rest of the equal parts
of the strait line O F be drawn in like manner so
many equal arches, all those arches together taken
will be equal to the whole arch B F, and the half
of them, namely, those that are comprehended
between O and Z, or between Z and F, will be
equal to the arch B Q or Q F, and in sum,
what part soever the strait line O <i>c</i> be of the
strait line O F, the same part will the arch O <i>c</i> be
of the arch B F, though both the arch and the
chord be infinitely bisected. Now seeing the
arch O <i>c</i> is more crooked than that part of the
arch B F which is equal to it; and seeing also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>that the more the strait line X <i>c</i> is produced, the
more it diverges from the strait line X O, if the
points O and <i>c</i> be understood to be moved forwards
with strait motion in X O and X <i>c</i>, the
arch O <i>c</i> will thereby be extended by little and
little, till at the last it come somewhere to have
the same crookedness with that part of the arch B F
which is equal to it. In like manner, if the strait
line X <i>b</i> be drawn, and the point <i>b</i> be understood
to be moved forwards at the same time, the arch
<i>c b</i> will also by little and little be extended, till
its crookedness come to be equal to the crookedness
of that part of the arch B F which is equal
to it. And the same will happen in all those
small equal arches which are described upon so
many equal parts of the strait line O F. It is also
manifest, that by strait motion in X O and X Z
all those small arches will lie in the arch B F,
in the points B, Q and F. And though the same
small equal arches should not be coincident with
the equal parts of the arch B F in all the other
points thereof, yet certainly they will constitute
two crooked lines, not only equal to the two
arches B Q and Q F, and equally crooked, but
also having their cavity towards the same parts;
which how it should be, unless all those small
arches should be coincident with the arch B F in
all its points, is not imaginable. They are therefore
coincident, and all the strait lines drawn
from X, and passing through the points of division
of the strait line O F, will also divide the arch
B F into the same proportions into which O F is
divided.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now seeing X <i>b</i> cuts off from the point B the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>fourth part of the arch B F, let that fourth part
be B <i>e</i>; and let the sine thereof, <i>f e</i>, be produced
to F T in <i>g</i>, for so <i>f e</i> will be the fourth part of
the strait line <i>f g</i>, because as O <i>b</i> is to O F, so is
<i>f e</i> to <i>f g</i>. But B T is greater than <i>f g</i>; and
therefore the same B T is greater than four sines
of the fourth part of the arch B F. And in like
manner, if the arch B F be subdivided into any
number of equal parts whatsoever, it may be
proved that the strait line B T is greater than the
sine of one of those small arches, so many times
taken as there be parts made of the whole arch
B F. Wherefore the strait line B T is not less
than the arch B F. But neither can it be greater,
because if any strait line whatsoever, less than
B T, be drawn below B T, parallel to it, and terminated
in the strait lines X B and X T, it would
cut the arch B F; and so the sine of some one of the
parts of the arch B F, taken so often as that small
arch is found in the whole arch B F, would be
greater than so many of the same arches; which
is absurd. Wherefore the strait line B T is equal
to the arch B F; and the strait line B V equal to
the arch of the quadrant B F D; and B V four
times taken, equal to the perimeter of the circle
described with the radius A B. Also the arch
B F and the strait line B T are everywhere divided
into the same proportions; and consequently any
given angle, whether greater or less than B A F,
may be divided into any proportion given.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the strait line B V, though its magnitude
fall within the terms assigned by Archimedes, is
found, if computed by the canon of signs, to be
somewhat greater than that which is exhibited by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>the Rudolphine numbers. Nevertheless, if in the
place of B T, another strait line, though never so
little less, be substituted, the division of angles is
immediately lost, as may by any man be demonstrated
by this very scheme.</p>

<p class='c001'>Howsoever, if any man think this my strait line
B V to be too great, yet, seeing the arch and all the
parallels are everywhere so exactly divided, and
B V comes so near to the truth, I desire he would
search out the reason, why, granting B V to be
precisely true, the arches cut off should not be
equal.</p>

<p class='c001'>But some man may yet ask the reason why the
strait lines, drawn from X through the equal parts
of the arch B F, should cut off in the tangent B V
so many strait lines equal to them, seeing the connected
straight line X V passes not through the
point D, but cuts the strait line A D produced in <i>l</i>;
and consequently require some determination of
this problem. Concerning which, I will say what
I think to be the reason, namely, that whilst the
magnitude of the arch doth not exceed the magnitude
of the radius, that is, the magnitude of the
tangent B C, both the arch and the tangent are cut
alike by the strait lines drawn from X; otherwise
not. For A V being connected, cutting the arch
B H D in I, if X C being drawn should cut the
same arch in the same point I, it would be as true
that the arch B I is equal to the radius B C, as it is
true that the arch B F is equal to the strait line B T;
and drawing X K it would cut the arch B I in the
midst in <i>i</i>; also drawing A <i>i</i> and producing it to the
tangent B C in <i>k</i>, the strait line B <i>k</i> will be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>tangent of the arch B <i>i</i>, (which arch is equal to
half the radius) and the same strait line B <i>k</i> will
be equal to the strait line <i>k</i> I. I say all this is true,
if the preceding demonstration be true; and consequently
the proportional section of the arch and
its tangent proceeds hitherto. But it is manifest
by the golden rule, that taking B <i>h</i> double to B T,
the line X <i>h</i> shall not cut off the arch B E, which
is double to the arch B F, but a much greater. For
the magnitude of the straight lines X M, X B, and
M E, being known (in numbers), the magnitude of
the strait line cut off in the tangent by the strait
line X E produced to the tangent, may also be
known; and it will be found to be less than B <i>h</i>;
Wherefore the strait line X <i>h</i> being drawn, will cut
off a part of the arch of the quadrant greater than
the arch B E. But I shall speak more fully in
the next article concerning the magnitude of the
arch B I.</p>

<p class='c001'>And let this be the first attempt for the finding
out of the dimension of a circle by the section of
the arch B F.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The second attempt for the finding out of the dimension of a circle from the consideration of the nature of crookedness.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art20.3'></a>3. I shall now attempt the same by arguments
drawn from the nature of the crookedness of the
circle itself; but I shall first set down some premises
necessary for this speculation; and</p>

<p class='c001'>First, if a strait line be bowed into an arch of
a circle equal to it, as when a stretched thread,
which toucheth a right cylinder, is so bowed in
every point, that it be everywhere coincident with
the perimeter of the base of the cylinder, the
flexion of that line will be equal, in all its points;
and consequently the crookedness of the arch of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>circle is everywhere uniform; which needs no other
demonstration than this, that the perimeter of a
circle is an uniform line.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, and consequently: if two unequal
arches of the same circle be made by the bowing of
two strait lines equal to them, the flexion of the
longer line, whilst it is bowed into the greater
arch, is greater than the flexion of the shorter line,
whilst it is bowed into the lesser arch, according
to the proportion of the arches themselves; and
consequently, the crookedness of the greater arch
is to the crookedness of the lesser arch, as the
greater arch is to the lesser arch.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly: if two unequal circles and a strait line
touch one another in the same point, the crookedness
of any arch taken in the lesser circle, will be
greater than the crookedness of an arch equal to it
taken in the greater circle, in reciprocal proportion
to that of the radii with which the circles are
described; or, which is all one, any strait line
being drawn from the point of contact till it cut
both the circumferences, as the part of that strait
line cut off by the circumference of the greater
circle to that part which is cut off by the circumference
of the lesser circle.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig20.2'></a>For let A B and A C (in the <a href='#fig20.f2'>second figure</a>) be
two circles, touching one another, and the strait
line A D in the point A; and let their centres be
E and F; and let it be supposed, that as A E is to
A F, so is the arch A B to the arch A H. I say the
crookedness of the arch A C is to the crookedness
of the arch A H, as A E is to A F. For let the
strait line A D be supposed to be equal to the arch
A B, and the strait line A G to the arch A C; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>let A D, for example, be double to A G. Therefore,
by reason of the likeness of the arches A B
and A C, the strait line A B will be double to the
strait line A C, and the radius A E double to the radius
A F, and the arch A B double to the arch A H.
And because the strait line A D is so bowed to be
coincident with the arch A B equal to it, as the
strait line A G is bowed to be coincident with the
arch A C equal also to it, the flexion of the strait
line A G into the crooked line A C will be equal to
the flexion of the strait line A D into the crooked
line A B. But the flexion of the strait line A D
into the crooked line A B is double to the flexion
of the strait line A G into the crooked line A H;
and therefore the flexion of the strait line A G into
the crooked line A C is double to the flexion of
the same strait line A G into the crooked line
A H. Wherefore, as the arch A B is to the arch
A C or A H; or as the radius A E is to the radius
A F; or as the chord A B is to the chord A C; so
reciprocally is the flexion or uniform crookedness
of the arch A C, to the flexion or uniform crookedness
of the arch A H, namely, here double. And
this may by the same method be demonstrated in
circles whose perimeters are to one another triple,
quadruple, or in whatsoever given proportion. The
crookedness therefore of two equal arches taken in
several circles are in proportion reciprocal to that
of their radii, or like arches, or like chords; which
was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig20.3'></a>Let the square A B C D be again described (in
the <a href='#fig20.f3'>third figure</a>), and in it the quadrants A B D,
B C A and D A C; and dividing each side of the
square A B C D in the midst in E, F, G and H, let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>E G and F H be connected, which will cut one another
in the centre of the square at I, and divide
the arch of the quadrant A B D into three equal
parts in K and L. Also the diagonals A C and
B D being drawn will cut one another in I, and
divide the arches B K D and C L A into two equal
parts in M and N. Then with the radius B F let
the arch F E be drawn, cutting the diagonal B D
in O; and dividing the arch B M in the midst in P,
let the strait line E <i>a</i> equal to the chord B P be set
off from the point E in the arch E F, and let the
arch <i>a b</i> be taken equal to the arch O <i>a</i>, and let
B <i>a</i> and B <i>b</i> be drawn and produced to the arch
A N in <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>; and lastly, let the strait line A <i>d</i>
be drawn. I say the strait line A <i>d</i> is equal to the
arch A N or B M.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have proved in the preceding article, that the
arch E O is twice as crooked as the arch B P, that
is to say, that the arch E O is so much more
crooked than the arch B P, as the arch B P is more
crooked than the strait line E <i>a</i>. The crookedness
therefore of the chord E <i>a</i>, of the arch B P, and of
the arch E O, are as 0, 1, 2. Also the difference
between the arches E O and E O, the difference
between the arches E O and E <i>a</i>, and the difference
between the arches E O and E <i>b</i>, are as 0, 1, 2. So
also the difference between the arches A N and
A N, the difference between the arches A N and
A <i>c</i>, and the difference between the arches A N
and A <i>d</i>, are as 0, 1, 2; and the strait line A <i>c</i> is
double to the chord B P or E <i>a</i>, and the strait line
A <i>d</i> double to the chord E <i>b</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, let the strait line B F be divided in the
midst in Q, and the arch B P in the midst in R;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>and describing the quadrant B Q S (whose arch
Q S is a fourth part of the arch of the quadrant
B M D, as the arch B R is a fourth part of the arch
B M, which is the arch of the semiquadrant A B M)
let the chord S <i>e</i> equal to the chord B R be set off
from the point S in the arch S Q; and let B <i>e</i> be
drawn and produced to the arch A N in <i>f</i>; which
being done, the strait line A <i>f</i> will be quadruple to
the chord B R or S <i>e</i>. And seeing the crookedness
of the arch S <i>e</i>, or of the arch A <i>c</i>, is double
to the crookedness of the arch B R, the excess of
the crookedness of the arch A <i>f</i> above the crookedness
of the arch A <i>c</i> will be subduple to the
excess of the crookedness of the arch A <i>c</i> above the
crookedness of the arch A N; and therefore the
arch N <i>c</i> will be double to the arch <i>c f</i>. Wherefore
the arch <i>c d</i> is divided in the midst in <i>f</i>, and the
arch N <i>f</i> is ¾ of the arch N <i>d</i>. And in like manner
if the arch B R be bisected in V, and the strait
line B Q in X, and the quadrant B X Y be described,
and the strait line Y <i>g</i> equal to the chord
B V be set off from the point Y in the arch Y X,
it may be demonstrated that the strait line B <i>g</i>
being drawn and produced to the arch A N, will
cut the arch <i>f d</i> into two equal parts, and that a
strait line drawn from A to the point of that section,
will be equal to eight chords of the arch B V,
and so on perpetually; and consequently, that the
strait line A <i>d</i> is equal to so many equal chords of
equal parts of the arch B M, as may be made by
infinite bisections. Wherefore the strait line A <i>d</i>
is equal to the arch B M or A N, that is, to half
the arch of the quadrant A B D or B C A.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. An arch being given not greater than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the arch of a quadrant (for being made greater, it
comes again towards the radius B A produced,
from which it receded before) if a strait line double
to the chord of half the given arch be adapted
from the beginning of the arch, and by how much
the arch that is subtended by it is greater than the
given arch, by so much a greater arch be subtended
by another strait line, this strait line shall
be equal to the first given arch.</p>

<p class='c001'>Supposing the strait line B V (in <a href='#fig20.f1'>fig. 1</a>) be equal
to the arch of the quadrant B H D, and A V be
connected cutting the arch B H D in I, it may be
asked what proportion the arch B I has to the
arch I D. Let therefore the arch A Y be divided
in the midst in <i>o</i>, and in the strait line A D let
A <i>p</i> be taken equal, and A <i>q</i> double to the drawn
chord A <i>o</i>. Then upon the centre A, with the
radius A <i>q</i>, let an arch of a circle be drawn cutting
the arch A Y in <i>r</i>, and let the arch Y <i>r</i> be doubled
at <i>t</i>; which being done, the drawn strait line A <i>t</i>
(by what has been last demonstrated) will be
equal to the arch A Y. Again, upon the centre A
with the radius A <i>t</i> let the arch <i>t u</i> be drawn
cutting A D in <i>u</i>; and the strait line A <i>u</i> will be
equal to the arch A Y. From the point <i>u</i> let the
strait line <i>u s</i> be drawn equal and parallel to the
strait line A B, cutting M N in <i>x</i>, and bisected by
M N in the same point <i>x</i>. Therefore the strait
line A <i>x</i> being drawn and produced till it meet
with B C produced in V, it will cut off B V double
to B <i>s</i>, that is, equal to the arch B H D. Now let
the point, where the strait line A V cuts the arch
B H D, be I; and let the arch D I be divided in
the midst in <i>y</i>; and in the strait line D C, let D <i>z</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>be taken equal, and D δ double to the drawn chord
D <i>y</i>; and upon the centre D with the radius D δ
let an arch of a circle be drawn cutting the arch
B H D in the point <i>n</i>; and let the arch <i>n m</i> be
taken equal to the arch I <i>n</i>; which being done,
the strait line D <i>m</i> will (by the last foregoing
corollary) be equal to the arch D I. If now the
strait lines D <i>m</i> and C V be equal, the arch B I
will be equal to the radius A B or B C; and consequently
X C being drawn, will pass through the
point I. Moreover, if the semicircle B H D ϐ being
completed, the strait lines ϐ I and B I be drawn,
making a right angle (in the semicircle) at I, and
the arch B I be divided in the midst at <i>i</i>, it will
follow that A <i>i</i> being connected will be parallel to
the strait line ϐ I, and being produced to B C in <i>k</i>,
will cut off the strait line B <i>k</i> equal to the strait
line <i>k</i> I, and equal also to the strait line A γ cut
off in A D by the strait line ϐ I. All which is
manifest, supposing the arch B I and the radius
B C to be equal.</p>

<p class='c001'>But that the arch B I and the radius B C are
precisely equal, cannot (how true soever it be) be
demonstrated, unless that be first proved which is
contained in <a href='#art20.1'>art. 1</a>, namely, that the strait lines
drawn from X through the equal parts of O F
(produced to a certain length) cut off so many
parts also in the tangent B C severally equal to
the several arches cut off; which they do most
exactly as far as B C in the tangent, and B I in the
arch B E; insomuch that no inequality between
the arch B I and the radius B C can be discovered
either by the hand or by ratiocination. It is
therefore to be further enquired, whether the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>strait line A V cut the arch of the quadrant in I
in the same proportion as the point C divides the
strait line B V, which is equal to the arch of the
quadrant. But however this be, it has been demonstrated
that the strait line B V is equal to the
arch B H D.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The third attempt; and some things propounded to be further searched into.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art20.4'></a>4. I shall now attempt the same dimension of a
circle another way, assuming the two following
lemmas.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='lem20.1'></a>Lemma <span class='fss'>I</span>. If to the arch of a quadrant, and the
radius, there be taken in continual proportion a
third line Z; then the arch of the semiquadrant,
half the chord of the quadrant, and Z, will also be
in continual proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>For seeing the radius is a mean proportional
between the chord of a quadrant and its semichord,
and the same radius a mean proportional
between the arch of the quadrant and Z, the
square of the radius will be equal as well to the
rectangle made of the chord and semichord of the
quadrant, as to the rectangle made of the arch of
the quadrant and Z; and these two rectangles
will be equal to one another. Wherefore, as the
arch of a quadrant is to its chord, so reciprocally
is half the chord of the quadrant to Z. But as the
arch of the quadrant is to its chord, so is half the
arch of the quadrant to half the chord of the
quadrant. Wherefore, as half the arch of the
quadrant is to half the chord of the quadrant (or
to the sine of 45 degrees), so is half the chord of
the quadrant to Z; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='lem20.2'></a>Lemma <span class='fss'>II</span>. The radius, the arch of the semiquadrant,
the sine of 45 degrees, and the semiradius,
are proportional.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>For seeing the sine of 45 degrees is a mean
proportional between the radius and the semiradius;
and the same sine of 45 degrees is also a
mean proportional (by the <a href='#lem20.1'>precedent lemma</a>) between
the arch of 45 degrees and Z; the square
of the sine of 45 degrees will be equal as well to
the rectangle made of the radius and semiradius,
as to the rectangle made of the arch of 45 degrees
and Z. Wherefore, as the radius is to the arch of
45 degrees, so reciprocally is Z to the semiradius;
which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig20.4'></a>Let now A B C D (in <a href='#fig20.f4'>fig. 4</a>) be a square; and
with the radii A B, B C and D A, let the three
quadrants A B D, B C A and D A C, be described;
and let the strait lines E F and G H, drawn parallel
to the sides B C and A B, divide the square A B C D
into four equal squares. They will therefore cut
the arch of the quadrant A B D into three equal
parts in I and K, and the arch of the quadrant
B C A into three equal parts in K and L. Also let
the diagonals A C and B D be drawn, cutting the
arches B I D and A L C in M and N. Then upon
the centre H with the radius H F equal to half
the chord of the arch B M D, or to the sine of 45
degrees, let the arch F O be drawn cutting the
arch C K in O; and let A O be drawn and produced
till it meet with B C produced in P; also
let it cut the arch B M D in Q, and the strait line
D C in R. If now the strait line H Q be equal to
the strait line D R, and being produced to D C in
S, cut off D S equal to half the strait line B P; I
say then the strait line B P will be equal to the
arch B M D.</p>

<p class='c001'>For seeing P B A and A D R are like triangles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>it will be as P B to the radius B A or A D, so A D
to D R; and therefore as well P B, A D and D R,
as P B, A D (or A Q) and Q H are in continual
proportion; and producing H O to D C in T, D T
will be equal to the sine of 45 degrees, as shall by
and by be demonstrated. Now D S, D T and D R
are in continual proportion by the <a href='#lem20.1'>first lemma</a>;
and by the <a href='#lem20.2'>second lemma</a> D C. D S:: D R. D F are
proportionals. And thus it will be, whether B P
be equal or not equal to the arch of the quadrant
B M D. But if they be equal, it will then be, as
that part of the arch B M D which is equal to the
radius, is to the remainder of the same arch B M D;
so A Q to H Q, or so B C to C P. And then will
B P and the arch B M D be equal. But it is not
demonstrated that the strait lines H Q and D R
are equal; though if from the point B there be
drawn (by the construction of <a href='#fig20.f1'>fig. 1</a>) a strait line
equal to the arch B M D, then D R to H Q, and
also the half of the strait line B P to D S, will
always be so equal, that no inequality can be discovered
between them. I will therefore leave this
to be further searched into. For though it be
almost out of doubt, that the strait line B P and
the arch B M D are equal, yet that may not be
received without demonstration; and means of
demonstration the circular line admitteth none
that is not grounded upon the nature of flexion, or
of angles. But by that way I have already exhibited
a strait line equal to the arch of a quadrant
in the first and second aggression.</p>

<p class='c001'>It remains that I prove D T to be equal to the
sine of 45 degrees.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>In B A produced let A V be taken equal to the
sine of 45 degrees; and drawing and producing
V H, it will cut the arch of the quadrant C N A in
the midst in N, and the same arch again in O, and
the strait line D C in T, so that D T will be equal
to the sine of 45 degrees, or to the strait line A V;
also the strait line V H will be equal to the strait
line H I, or the sine of 60 degrees.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the square of A V is equal to two squares of
the semiradius; and consequently the square of
V H is equal to three squares of the semiradius.
But H I is a mean proportional between the semiradius
and three semiradii; and, therefore, the
square of H I is equal to three squares of the semiradius.
Wherefore H I is equal to H V. But
because A D is cut in the midst in H, therefore V H
and H T are equal; and, therefore, also D T is
equal to the sine of 45 degrees. In the radius
B A let B X be taken equal to the sine of 45 degrees;
for so V X will be equal to the radius; and
it will be as V A to A H the semiradius, so V X the
radius to X N the sine of 45 degrees. Wherefore
V H produced passes through N. Lastly, upon the
centre V with the radius V A let the arch of a circle
be drawn cutting V H in Y; which being done,
V Y will be equal to H O (for H O is, by construction,
equal to the sine of 45 degrees) and Y H will
be equal to O T; and, therefore, V T passes through
O. All which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>I will here add certain problems, of which if
any analyst can make the construction, he will
thereby be able to judge clearly of what I have now
said concerning the dimension of a circle. Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>these problems are nothing else (at least to sense)
but certain symptoms accompanying the construction
of the <a href='#fig20.f1'>first</a> and <a href='#fig20.f3'>third figure</a> of this chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig20.5'></a>Describing, therefore, again, the square A B C D
(in <a href='#fig20.f5'>fig. 5</a>) and the three quadrants A B D, B C A
and D A C, let the diagonals A C and B D be drawn,
cutting the arches B H D and C I A in the middle
in H and I; and the strait lines E F and G L, dividing
the square A B C D into four equal squares,
and trisecting the arches B H D and C I A, namely,
B H D in K and M, and C I A in M and O. Then
dividing the arch B K in the midst in P, let Q P
the sine of the arch B P, be drawn and produced to
R, so that Q R be double to Q P; and, connecting
K R, let it be produced one way to B C in S, and
the other way to B A produced in T. Also let B V
be made triple to B S, and consequently, (by the
<a href='#art20.2'>second article</a> of this chapter) equal to the arch
B D. This construction is the same with that of
the first figure, which I thought fit to renew discharged
of all lines but such as are necessary for my
present purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, therefore, if A V be drawn,
cutting the arch B H D in X, and the side D C in
Z, I desire some analyst would, if he can, give a
reason why the strait lines T E and T C should cut
the arch B D, the one in Y, the other in X, so as
to make the arch B Y equal to the arch Y X; or if
they be not equal, that he would determine their
difference.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, if in the side D A, the strait line D <i>a</i>
be taken equal to D Z, and V <i>a</i> be drawn; why
V <i>a</i> and V B should be equal; or if they be not
equal, what is the difference.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Thirdly, drawing Z <i>b</i> parallel and equal to the
side C B, cutting the arch B H D in <i>c</i>, and drawing
the strait line A <i>c</i>, and producing it to B V in
<i>d</i>; why A <i>d</i> should be equal and parallel to the
strait line <i>a</i> V, and consequently equal also to the
arch B D.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fourthly, drawing <i>e</i> K the sine of the arch B K,
and taking (in <i>e</i> A produced) <i>e f</i> equal to the diagonal
A C, and connecting <i>f</i> C; why <i>f</i> C should
pass through <i>a</i> (which point being given, the length
of the arch B H D is also given) and <i>c</i>; and why
<i>f e</i> and <i>f c</i> should be equal; or if not, why unequal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fifthly, drawing <i>f</i> Z, I desire he would show,
why it is equal to B V, or to the arch B D; or if
they be not equal, what is their difference.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sixthly, granting <i>f</i> Z to be equal to the arch
B D, I desire he would determine whether it fall
all without the arch B C A, or cut the same, or
touch it, and in what point.</p>

<p class='c001'>Seventhly, the semicircle B D <i>g</i> being completed,
why <i>g</i> I being drawn and produced, should pass
through X, by which point X the length of the
arch B D is determined. And the same <i>g</i> I being
yet further produced to D C in <i>h</i>, why A <i>d</i>, which
is equal to the arch B D, should pass through that
point <i>h</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Eighthly, upon the centre of the square A B C D,
which let be <i>k</i>, the arch of the quadrant E <i>i</i> L being
drawn, cutting <i>e</i> K produced in <i>i</i>, why the drawn
strait line <i>i</i> X should be parallel to the side C D.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ninthly, in the sides B A and B C taking <i>g l</i>
and B <i>m</i> severally equal to half B V, or to the arch
B H, and drawing <i>m n</i> parallel and equal to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>side B A, cutting the arch B D in <i>o</i>, why the strait
line which connects V <i>l</i> should pass through the
point <i>o</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tenthly, I would know of him why the strait
line which connects <i>a</i> H should be equal to B <i>m</i>;
or if not, how much it differs from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The analyst that can solve these problems without
knowing first the length of the arch B D, or
using any other known method than that which
proceeds by perpetual bisection of an angle, or is
drawn from the consideration of the nature of
flexion, shall do more than ordinary geometry is
able to perform. But if the dimension of a circle
cannot be found by any other method, then I have
either found it, or it is not at all to be found.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the known length of the arch of a quadrant,
and from the proportional division of the arch
and of the tangent B C, may be deduced the section
of an angle into any given proportion; as also
the squaring of the circle, the squaring of a given
sector, and many the like propositions, which it is
not necessary here to demonstrate. I will, therefore,
only exhibit a strait line equal to the spiral of

<div class='sidenote'>The equation of the spiral of Archimedes with a strait line.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art20.5'></a>5. The length of the perimeter of a circle being
found, that strait line is also found, which touches
a spiral at the end of its first conversion. <a id='fig20.6'></a>For upon
the centre A (in <a href='#fig20.f6'>fig. 6</a>) let the circle B C D E be described;
and in it let Archimedes' spiral A F G H B
be drawn, beginning at A and ending at B. Through
the centre A let the strait line C E be drawn, cutting
the diameter B D at right angles; and let it be
produced to I, so that A I be equal to the perimeter
B C D E B. Therefore I B being drawn will touch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>the spiral A F G H B in B; which is demonstrated
by Archimedes in his book <span lang="la"><cite>De Spiralibus</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>And for a strait line equal to the given spiral
A F G H B, it may be found thus.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the strait line A I, which is equal to the perimeter
B C D E, be bisected in K; and taking K L
equal to the radius A B, let the rectangle I L be
completed. Let M L be understood to be the axis,
and K L the base of a parabola, and let M K be
the crooked line thereof. Now if the point M be
conceived to be so moved by the concourse of two
movents, the one from I M to K L with velocity
encreasing continually in the same proportion with
the times, the other from M L to I K uniformly,
that both those motions begin together in M and
end in K; Galilæus has demonstrated that by such
motion of the point M, the crooked line of a parabola
will be described. Again, if the point A be
conceived to be moved uniformly in the strait line
A B, and in the same time to be carried round
upon the centre A by the circular motion of all the
points between A and B; Archimedes has demonstrated
that by such motion will be described a
spiral line. And seeing the circles of all these motions
are concentric in A; and the interior circle
is always less than the exterior in the proportion
of the times in which A B is passed over with uniform
motion; the velocity also of the circular motion
of the point A will continually increase proportionally
to the times. And thus far the generations
of the parabolical line M K, and of the spiral
line A F G H B, are like. But the uniform motion
in A B concurring with circular motion in the perimeters
of all the concentric circles, describes that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>circle, whose centre is A, and perimeter B C D E;
and, therefore, that circle is (by the coroll. of <a href='#art20.1'>art. 1</a>,
chap, <span class='fss'>XVI</span>) the aggregate of all the velocities together
taken of the point A whilst it describes the
spiral A F G H B. Also the rectangle I K L M is
the aggregate of all the velocities together taken
of the point M, whilst it describes the crooked line
M K. And, therefore the whole velocity by which
the parabolical line M K is described, is to the
whole velocity with which the spiral line A F G H B
is described in the same time, as the rectangle
I K L M is to the circle B C D E, that is to the
triangle A I B. But because A I is bisected in K,
and the strait lines I M and A B are equal, therefore
the rectangle I K L M and the triangle A I B
are also equal. Wherefore the spiral line A F G H B,
and the parabolical line M K, being described with
equal velocity and in equal times, are equal to one
another. Now, in the <a href='#art18.1'>first article</a> of chap. <span class='fss'>XVIII</span>, a
strait line is found out equal to any parabolical
line. Wherefore also a strait line is found out equal
to a given spiral line of the first revolution described
by Archimedes; which was to be done.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the analysis of geometricians by the powers of lines.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art20.6'></a>6. In the sixth chapter, which is of <em>Method</em>,
that which I should there have spoken of the analytics
of geometricians I thought fit to defer, because
I could not there have been understood, as
not having then so much as named <em>lines</em>, <em>superficies</em>,
<em>solids</em>, <em>equal</em> and <em>unequal</em>, <i>&#38;c.</i> Wherefore I
will in this place set down my thoughts concerning
it.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Analysis</em> is continual reasoning from the definitions
of the terms of a proposition we suppose
true, and again from the definitions of the terms of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>those definitions, and so on, till we come to some
things known, the composition whereof is the
demonstration of the truth or falsity of the first
supposition; and this composition or demonstration
is that we call <em>Synthesis</em>. <em>Analytica</em>, therefore, is
that art, by which our reason proceeds from something
supposed, to principles, that is, to prime
propositions, or to such as are known by these, till
we have so many known propositions as are sufficient
for the demonstration of the truth or falsity
of the thing supposed. <em>Synthetica</em> is the art itself
of demonstration. Synthesis, therefore, and analysis,
differ in nothing, but in proceeding forwards
or backwards; and <em>Logistica</em> comprehends both.
So that in the analysis or synthesis of any question,
that is to say, of any problem, the terms of all the
propositions ought to be convertible; or if they be
enunciated hypothetically, the truth of the consequent
ought not only to follow out of the truth of
its antecedent, but contrarily also the truth of the
antecedent must necessarily be inferred from the
truth of the consequent. For otherwise, when by
resolution we are arrived at principles, we cannot
by composition return directly back to the thing
sought for. For those terms which are the first in
analysis, will be the last in synthesis; as for example,
when in <em>resolving</em>, we say, these two
rectangles are equal, and therefore their sides are
reciprocally proportional, we must necessarily in
<em>compounding</em> say, the sides of these rectangles are
reciprocally proportional, and therefore the rectangles
themselves are equal; which we could not
say, unless <em>rectangles have their sides reciprocally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>proportional</em>, and <em>rectangles are equal</em>,
were terms convertible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now in every analysis, that which is sought is
the proportion of two quantities; by which proportion,
a figure being described, the quantity
sought for may be exposed to sense. And this
<em>exposition</em> is the end and solution of the question,
or the construction of the problem.</p>

<p class='c001'>And seeing analysis is reasoning from something
supposed, till we come to principles, that is, to
definitions, or to theorems formerly known; and
seeing the same reasoning tends in the last place to
some equation, we can therefore make no end of resolving,
till we come at last to the causes themselves
of equality and inequality, or to theorems formerly
demonstrated from those causes; and so have a
sufficient number of those theorems for the demonstration
of the thing sought for.</p>

<p class='c001'>And seeing also, that the end of the analytics is
either the construction of such a problem as is possible,
or the detection of the impossibility thereof;
whensoever the problem may be solved, the analyst
must not stay, till he come to those things which
contain the efficient cause of that whereof he is to
make construction. But he must of necessity stay,
when he comes to prime propositions; and these
are definitions. These definitions therefore must
contain the efficient cause of his construction; I
say of his construction, not of the conclusion which
he demonstrates; for the cause of the conclusion
is contained in the premised propositions; that is
to say, the truth of the proposition he proves is
drawn from the propositions which prove the same.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>But the cause of his construction is in the things
themselves, and consists in motion, or in the concourse
of motions. Wherefore those propositions,
in which analysis ends, are definitions, but such as
signify in what manner the construction or generation
of the thing proceeds. For otherwise, when
he goes back by synthesis to the proof of his
problem, he will come to no demonstration at all;
there being no true demonstration but such as is
scientifical; and no demonstration is scientifical,
but that which proceeds from the knowledge of the
causes from which the construction of the problem
is drawn. To collect therefore what has been said
into few words; <span class='fss'>ANALYSIS</span> <em>is ratiocination from
the supposed construction or generation of a thing
to the efficient cause or coefficient causes of that
which is constructed or generated. And</em> <span class='fss'>SYNTHESIS</span>
<em>is ratiocination from the first causes of
the construction, continued through all the middle
causes till we come to the thing itself which is
constructed or generated</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But because there are many means by which the
same thing may be generated, or the same problem
be constructed, therefore neither do all geometricians,
nor doth the same geometrician always, use
one and the same method. For, if to a certain
quantity given, it be required to construct another
quantity equal, there may be some that will inquire
whether this may not be done by means of some
motion. For there are quantities, whose equality
and inequality may be argued from motion and
time, as well as from congruence; and there is
motion, by which two quantities, whether lines or
superficies, though one of them be crooked, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>other strait, may be made congruous or coincident.
And this method Archimedes made use of in his
book <span lang="la"><cite>De Spiralibus</cite></span>. Also the equality or inequality
of two quantities may be found out and
demonstrated from the consideration of weight, as
the same Archimedes did in his quadrature of the
parabola. Besides, equality and inequality are found
out often by the division of the two quantities into
parts which are considered as indivisable; as
Cavallerius Bonaventura has done in our time, and
Archimedes often. Lastly, the same is performed
by the consideration of the powers of lines, or the
roots of those powers, and by the multiplication,
division, addition, and subtraction, as also by the
extraction of the roots of those powers, or by finding
where strait lines of the same proportion
terminate. For example, when any number of
strait lines, how many soever, are drawn from a
strait line and pass all through the same point,
look what proportion they have, and if their parts
continued from the point retain everywhere the
same proportion, they shall all terminate in a strait
line. And the same happens if the point be taken
between two circles. So that the places of all their
points of termination make either strait lines, or
circumferences of circles, and are called <em>plane
places</em>. So also when strait parallel lines are
applied to one strait line, if the parts of the strait
line to which they are applied be to one another in
proportion duplicate to that of the contiguous
applied lines, they will all terminate in a conical
section; which section, being the place of their
termination, is called a <em>solid place</em>, because it
serves for the finding out of the quantity of any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>equation which consists of three dimensions. There
are therefore three ways of finding out the cause of
equality or inequality between two given quantities;
namely, first, by the computation of <em>motions</em>; for
by equal motion, and equal time, equal spaces are
described; and ponderation is motion. Secondly,
by <em>indivisibles</em>: because all the parts together
taken are equal to the whole. And thirdly, by the
<em>powers</em>: for when they are equal, their roots also
are equal; and contrarily, the powers are equal,
when their roots are equal. But if the question
be much complicated, there cannot by any of these
ways be constituted a certain rule, from the supposition
of which of the unknown quantities the
analysis may best begin; nor out of the variety of
equations, that at first appear, which we were
best to choose; but the success will depend upon
dexterity, upon formerly acquired science, and
many times upon fortune.</p>

<p class='c001'>For no man can ever be a good analyst without
being first a good geometrician; nor do the rules
of analysis make a geometrician, as synthesis doth;
which begins at the very elements, and proceeds
by a logical use of the same. For the true teaching
of geometry is by synthesis, according to Euclid's
method; and he that hath Euclid for his master,
may be a geometrician without Vieta, though Vieta
was a most admirable geometrician; but he that
has Vieta for his master, not so, without Euclid.</p>

<p class='c001'>And as for that part of analysis which works by
the powers, though it be esteemed by some geometricians,
not the chiefest, to be the best way of
solving all problems, yet it is a thing of no great
extent; it being all contained in the doctrine of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>rectangles, and rectangled solids. So that although
they come to an equation which determines the
quantity sought, yet they cannot sometimes by
art exhibit that quantity in a plane, but in some
conic section; that is, as geometricians say, not
geometrically, but mechanically. Now such problems
as these, they call <em>solid</em>; and when they
cannot exhibit the quantity sought for with the
help of a conic section, they call it a <em>lineary</em> problem.
And therefore in the quantities of angles,
and of the arches of circles, there is no use at all
of the analytics which proceed by the powers; so
that the ancients pronounced it impossible to exhibit
in a plane the division of angles, except
bisection, and the bisection of the bisected parts,
otherwise than mechanically. For Pappus, (before
the 31st proposition of his fourth book) distinguishing
and defining the several kinds of problems,
says that "some are <em>plane</em>, others <em>solid</em>,
and others <em>lineary</em>. Those, therefore, which may
be solved by strait lines and the circumferences of
circles, (that is, which may be described with the
rule and compass, without any other instrument),
are fitly called <em>plane</em>; for the lines, by which
such problems are found out, have their generation
in a plane. But those which are solved by the
using of some one or more conic sections in their
construction, are called <em>solid</em>, because their construction
cannot be made without using the superficies
of solid figures, namely, of cones. There
remains the third kind, which is called <em>lineary</em>,
because other lines besides those already mentioned
are made use of in their construction, &#38;c." And a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>little after he says, "of this kind are the <em>spiral</em>
lines, the <em>quadratrices</em>, the <em>conchoeides</em>, and the
<em>cissoeides</em>, And geometricians think it no small
fault, when for the finding out of a plane problem
any man makes use of conics, or new lines." Now
he ranks the trisection of an angle among solid
problems, and the quinquesection among lineary.
But what! are the ancient geometricians to be
blamed, who made use of the quadratrix for the
finding out of a strait line equal to the arch of a
circle? And Pappus himself, was he faulty, when
he found out the trisection of an angle by the
help of an hyperbole? Or am I in the wrong,
who think I have found out the construction of
both these problems by the rule and compass only?
Neither they, nor I. For the ancients made use
of this analysis which proceeds by the powers;
and with them it was a fault to do that by a more
remote power, which might be done by a nearer;
as being an argument that they did not sufficiently
understand the nature of the thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The virtue of this kind of analysis consists in the
changing and turning and tossing of rectangles and
analogisms; and the skill of analysts is mere logic, by
which they are able methodically to find out whatsoever
lies hid either in the subject or predicate of the
conclusion sought for. But this doth not properly
belong to algebra, or the analytics specious, symbolical,
or cossick; which are, as I may say, the
<em>brachygraphy</em> of the analytics, and an art neither
of teaching nor learning geometry, but of registering
with brevity and celerity the inventions of
geometricians. For though it be easy to discourse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>by symbols of very remote propositions; yet
whether such discourse deserve to be thought very
profitable, when it is made without any ideas of
the things themselves, I know not.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>In simple motion, every strait line taken in the body moved is so carried, that it is always parallel to the places in which it formerly was.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art21.1'></a>1. I have already defined <em>simple motion</em> to be
that, in which the several points taken in a moved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>body do in several equal times describe several
equal arches. And therefore in simple circular
motion it is necessary that every strait line taken
in the moved body be always carried parallel to
itself; which I thus demonstrate.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig21.1'></a>First, let A B (in the <a href='#fig21.f1'>first figure</a>) be any strait
line taken in any solid body; and let A D be any
arch drawn upon any centre C and radius CA.
Let the point B be understood to describe towards
the same parts the arch B E, like and equal to the
arch A D. Now in the same time in which the
point A transmits the arch A D, the point B,
which by reason of its simple motion is supposed
to be carried with a velocity equal to that of A,
will transmit the arch B E; and at the end of
the same time the whole A B will be in D E; and
therefore A B and D E are equal. And seeing the
arches A D and B E are like and equal, their subtending
strait lines AD and BE will also be equal; and
therefore the four-sided figure A B D E will be a
parallelogram. Wherefore A B is carried parallel
to itself. And the same may be proved by the
same method, if any other strait line be taken in
the same moved body in which the strait line A B
was taken. So that all strait lines, taken in a
body moved with simple circular motion, will be
carried parallel to themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. <span class='fss'>I</span>. It is manifest that the same will
also happen in any body which hath simple motion,
though not circular. For all the points of any
strait line whatsoever will describe lines, though
not circular, yet equal; so that though the crooked
lines A D and B E were not arches of circles, but
of parabolas, ellipses, or of any other figures,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>yet both they, and their subtenses, and the strait
lines which join them, would be equal and parallel.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. <span class='fss'>II</span>. It is also manifest, that the radii
of the equal circles A D and B E, or the axis of a
sphere, will be so carried, as to be always parallel
to the places in which they formerly were. For
the strait line B F drawn to the centre of the arch
B E being equal to the radius A C, will also be
equal to the strait line F E or C D; and the angle
B F E will be equal to the angle A C D. Now the
intersection of the strait lines C A and B E being
at G, the angle C G E (seeing B E and A D are
parallel) will be equal to the angle D A C. But
the angle E B F is equal to the same angle D A C;
and therefore the angles C G E and E B F are also
equal. Wherefore A C and B F are parallel;
which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If circular motion be made about a resting centre, and in that circle there be an epicycle whose revolution is made the contrary way, in such manner that in equal times it make equal angles, every strait line taken in that epicycle will be so carried, that it will always be parallel to the places in which it formerly was.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art21.2'></a>2. Let there be a circle given (in the second
figure) whose centre is A, and radius A B; and
upon the centre B and any radius B C let the
epicycle C D E be described. Let the centre B
be understood to be carried about the centre A,
and the whole epicycle with it till it be coincident
with the circle F G H, whose centre is I; and let
B A I be any angle given. But in the time that
the centre B is moved to I, let the epicycle C D E
have a contrary revolution upon its own centre,
namely from E by D to C, according to the same
proportions; that is, in such manner, that in both
the circles, equal angles be made in equal times.
I say E C, the axis of the epicycle, will be always
carried parallel to itself. Let the angle F I G be
made equal to the angle B A I; I F and A B will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>therefore be parallel; and how much the axis
A G has departed from its former place A C (the
measure of which progression is the angle C A G,
or C B D, which I suppose equal to it) so much in
the same time has the axis I G, the same with B C,
departed from its own former situation. Wherefore,
in what time B C comes to I G by the motion
from B to I upon the centre A, in the same time
G will come to F by the contrary motion of the
epicycle; that is, it will be turned backwards to
F, and I G will lie in I F. But the angles F I G
and G A C are equal; and therefore A C, that is,
B C, and I F, (that is the axis, though in different
places) will be parallel. Wherefore, the axis of
the epicycle E D C will be carried always parallel
to itself; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. From hence it is manifest, that those
two annual motions which Copernicus ascribes
to the earth, are reducible to this one circular
simple motion, by which all the points of the
moved body are carried always with equal velocity,
that is, in equal times they make equal revolutions
uniformly.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, as it is the most simple, so it is the most
frequent of all circular motions; being the same
which is used by all men when they turn anything
round with their arms, as they do in grinding or
sifting. For all the points of the thing moved
describe lines which are like and equal to one
another. So that if a man had a ruler, in which
many pens' points of equal length were fastened,
he might with this one motion write many lines
at once.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Properties of simple motion.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span><a id='art21.3'></a>3. Having shown what simple motion is, I will
here also set down some properties of the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>First, when a body is moved with simple motion
in a fluid medium which hath no vacuity, it changes
the situation of all the parts of the fluid ambient
which resist its motion; I say there are no parts
so small of the fluid ambient, how far soever it be
continued, but do change their situation in such
manner, as that they leave their places continually
to other small parts that come into the same.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig21.2'></a>For (in the same <a href='#fig21.f2'>second figure</a>) let any body,
as K L M N, be understood to be moved with
simple circular motion; and let the circle, which
every point thereof describes, have any determined
quantity, suppose that of the same K L M N.
Wherefore the centre A and every other point,
and consequently the moved body itself, will be
carried sometimes towards the side where is K,
and sometimes towards the other side where
is M. When therefore it is carried to K, the
parts of the fluid medium on that side will go
back; and, supposing all space to be full, others
on the other side will succeed. And so it will be
when the body is carried to the side M, and to N,
and every way. Now when the nearest parts of
the fluid medium go back, it is necessary that the
parts next to those nearest parts go back also;
and supposing still all space to be full, other parts
will come into their places with succession perpetual
and infinite. Wherefore all, even the least
parts of the fluid medium, change their places, &#38;c.
Which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is evident from hence, that simple motion,
whether circular or not circular, of bodies which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>make perpetual returns to their former places,
hath greater or less force to dissipate the parts of
resisting bodies, as it is more or less swift, and as
the lines described have greater or less magnitude.
Now the greatest velocity that can be, may be
understood to be in the least circuit, and the least
in the greatest; and may be so supposed, when
there is need.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If a fluid be moved with simple circular motion, all the points taken in it will describe their circles in times proportional to the distances from the centre.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art21.4'></a>4. Secondly, supposing the same simple motion
in the air, water, or other fluid medium; the
parts of the medium, which adhere to the moved
body, will be carried about with the same motion
and velocity, so that in what time soever any point
of the movent finishes its circle, in the same time
every part of the medium, which adheres to the
movent, shall also describe such a part of its
circle, as is equal to the whole circle of the
movent; I say, it shall describe a part, and not
the whole circle, because all its parts receive their
motion from an interior concentric movent, and of
concentric circles the exterior are always greater
than the interior; nor can the motion imprinted
by any movent be of greater velocity than that of
the movent itself. From whence it follows, that
the more remote parts of the fluid ambient shall
finish their circles in times, which have to one
another the same proportion with their distances
from the movent. For every point of the fluid
ambient, as long as it toucheth the body which
carries it about, is carried about with it, and would
make the same circle, but that it is left behind so
much as the exterior circle exceeds the interior.
So that if we suppose some thing, which is not fluid,
to float in that part of the fluid ambient which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>nearest to the movent, it will together with the
movent be carried about. Now that part of the
fluid ambient, which is not the nearest but almost
the nearest, receiving its degree of velocity from
the nearest, which degree cannot be greater than
it was in the giver, doth therefore in the same
time make a circular line, not a whole circle, yet
equal to the whole circle of the nearest. Therefore
in the same time that the movent describes its
circle, that which doth not touch it shall not
describe its circle; yet it shall describe such a part
of it, as is equal to the whole circle of the movent.
And after the same manner, the more remote parts
of the ambient will describe in the same time such
parts of their circles, as shall be severally equal to
the whole circle of the movent; and, by consequent,
they shall finish their whole circles in times proportional
to their distances from the movent;
which was to be proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Simple motion dissipates heterogeneous and congregates<br>homogeneous bodies.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art21.5'></a>5. Thirdly, the same simple motion of a body
placed in a fluid medium, congregates or gathers
into one place such things as naturally float in that
medium, if they be homogeneous; and if they be
heterogeneous, it separates and dissipates them.
But if such things as be heterogeneous do not
float, but settle, then the same motion stirs and
mingles them disorderly together. For seeing
bodies, which are unlike to one another, that is,
heterogeneous bodies, are not unlike in that they
are bodies; for bodies, as bodies, have no difference;
but only from some special cause, that is,
from some internal motion, or motions of their
smallest parts (for I have shown in chap. <span class='fss'>IX</span>, <a href='#art9.9'>art. 9</a>,
that all mutation is such motion), it remains that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>heterogeneous bodies have their unlikeness or
difference from one another from their internal or
specifical motions. Now bodies which have such
difference receive unlike and different motions
from the same external common movent; and
therefore they will not be moved together, that is
to say, they will be dissipated. And being dissipated
they will necessarily at some time or other
meet with bodies like themselves, and be moved
alike and together with them; and afterwards
meeting with more bodies like themselves, they
will unite and become greater bodies. Wherefore
homogeneous bodies are congregated, and heterogeneous
dissipated by simple motion in a medium
where they naturally float. Again, such as being
in a fluid medium do not float, but sink, if the
motion of the fluid medium be strong enough,
will be stirred up and carried away by that motion,
and consequently they will be hindered from returning
to that place to which they sink naturally,
and in which only they would unite, and out of
which they are promiscuously carried; that is,
they are disorderly mingled.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now this motion, by which homogeneous bodies
are congregated and heterogeneous are scattered,
is that which is commonly called <em>fermentation</em>,
from the Latin <span lang="la"><i>fervere</i></span>; as the Greeks have their
Ζύμη, which signifies the same, from Ζέω <span lang="la"><i>ferveo</i></span>.
For seething makes all the parts of the water
change their places; and the parts of any thing,
that is thrown into it, will go several ways according
to their several natures. And yet all
<em>fervour</em> or seething is not caused by fire; for new
wine and many other things have also their fermentation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>and fervour, to which fire contributes
little, and sometimes nothing. But when in fermentation
we find heat, it is made by the fermentation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If a circle made by a movent moved with simple motion, be commensurable  to another circle made by a point which is carried about by  the same movent, all the points of both the circles will at some time  return to the same situation.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art21.6'></a>6. Fourthly, in what time soever the movent,
whose centre is A (in <a href='#fig21.f2'>fig. 2</a>) moved in K L N, shall,
by any number of revolutions, that is, when the
perimeters B I and K L N be commensurable, have
described a line equal to the circle which passes
through the points B and I; in the same time all
the points of the floating body, whose centre is B,
shall return to have the same situation in respect
of the movent, from which they departed. For
seeing it is as the distance B A, that is, as the
radius of the circle which passes through B I is to
the perimeter itself B I, so the radius of the circle
K L N is to the perimeter K L N; and seeing the
velocities of the points B and K are equal, the
time also of the revolution in I B to the time of
one revolution in K L N, will be as the perimeter
B I to the perimeter K L N; and therefore so
many revolutions in K L N, as together taken are
equal to the perimeter B I, will be finished in the
same time in which the whole perimeter B I is
finished; and therefore also the points L, N, F
and H, or any of the rest, will in the same time
return to the same situation from which they departed;
and this may be demonstrated, whatsoever
be the points considered. Wherefore all the points
shall in that time return to the same situation;
which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>From hence it follows, that if the perimeters B I
and L K N be not commensurable, then all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>points will never return to have the same situation
or configuration in respect of one another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If a sphere have simple motion, its motion will more  dissipate heterogeneous bodies by how much it is more remote from  the poles.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art21.7'></a>7. In simple motion, if the body moved be of a
spherical figure, it hath less force towards its poles
than towards its middle to dissipate heterogeneous,
or to congregate homogeneous bodies.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig21.3'></a>Let there be a sphere (as in the <a href='#fig21.3'>third figure</a>)
whose centre is A and diameter B C; and let it be
conceived to be moved with simple circular motion;
of which motion let the axis be the strait line D E,
cutting the diameter B C at right angles in A. Let
now the circle, which is described by any point B
of the sphere, have B F for its diameter; and taking
F G equal to B C, and dividing it in the middle in
H, the centre of the sphere A will, when half a
revolution is finished, lie in H. And seeing H F
and A B are equal, a circle described upon the
centre H with the radius H F or H G, will be equal
to the circle whose centre is A and radius A B.
And if the same motion be continued, the point B
will at the end of another half revolution return to
the place from whence it began to be moved; and
therefore at the end of half a revolution, the point B
will be carried to F, and the whole hemisphere D B E
into that hemisphere in which are the points L, K
and F. Wherefore that part of the fluid medium,
which is contiguous to the point F, will in the same
time go back the length of the strait line B F; and
in the return of the point F to B, that is, of G to C,
the fluid medium will go back as much in a strait
line from the point C. And this is the effect of
simple motion in the middle of the sphere, where
the distance from the poles is greatest. Let now
the point I be taken in the same sphere nearer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>the pole E, and through it let the strait line I K be
drawn parallel to the strait line B F, cutting the
arch F L in K, and the axis H L in M; then connecting
H K, upon H F let the perpendicular K N
be drawn. In the same time therefore that B
comes to F the point I will come to K, B F and
I K being equal and described with the same velocity.
Now the motion in I K to the fluid medium
upon which it works, namely, to that part of the
medium which is contiguous to the point K, is
oblique, whereas if it proceeded in the strait line
H K it would be perpendicular; and therefore
the motion which proceeds in I K has less power
than that which proceeds in H K with the same
velocity. But the motions in H K and H F do
equally thrust back the medium; and therefore
the part of the sphere at K moves the medium
less than the part at F, namely, so much less as
K N is less than H F. Wherefore also the same
motion hath less power to disperse heterogeneous,
and to congregate homogeneous bodies, when it is
nearer, than when it is more remote from the
poles; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. It is also necessary, that in planes which
are perpendicular to the axis, and more remote
than the pole itself from the middle of the sphere,
this simple motion have no effect. For the axis
D E with simple motion describes the superficies of
a cylinder; and towards the bases of the cylinder
there is in this motion no endeavour at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If a simple circular motion of a fluid body be hindered by  a body which is not fluid, the fluid body will spread itself  upon the superficies of that body.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art21.8'></a>8. If in a fluid medium moved about, as hath
been said, with simple motion, there be conceived
to float some other spherical body which is not fluid,
the parts of the medium, which are stopped by that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>body, will endeavour to spread themselves every
way upon the superficies of it. And this is manifest
enough by experience, namely, by the spreading
of water poured out upon a pavement. But the
reason of it may be this. Seeing the sphere A (in
<a href='#fig21.f3'>fig. 3</a>) is moved towards B, the medium also in
which it is moved will have the same motion. But
because in this motion it falls upon a body not
liquid, as G, so that it cannot go on; and seeing
the small parts of the medium cannot go forwards,
nor can they go directly backwards against the
force of the movent; it remains, therefore, that
they diffuse themselves upon the superficies of that
body, as towards O and P; which was to be
proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Circular motion about a fixed centre casteth off by the tangent  such things as lie upon the circumference &#38; stick not to it.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art21.9'></a>9. Compounded circular motion, in which all the
parts of the moved body do at once describe circumferences,
some greater, others less, according
to the proportion of their several distances from
the common centre, carries about with it such
bodies, as being not fluid, adhere to the body so
moved; and such as do not adhere, it casteth forwards
in a strait line which is a tangent to the
point from which they are cast off.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig21.4'></a>For let there be a circle whose radius is A B (in
<a href='#fig21.f4'>fig. 4</a>); and let a body be placed in the circumference
in B, which if it be fixed there, will necessarily
be carried about with it, as is manifest of
itself. But whilst the motion proceeds, let us suppose
that body to be unfixed in B. I say, the body
will continue its motion in the tangent B C. For
let both the radius A B and the sphere B be conceived
to consist of hard matter; and let us suppose
the radius A B to be stricken in the point B
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>by some other body which falls upon it in the tangent
D B. Now, therefore, there will be a motion
made by the concourse of two things, the one, endeavour
towards C in the strait line D B produced,
in which the body B would proceed, if it were not
retained by the radius A B; the other, the retention
itself. But the retention alone causeth no
endeavour towards the centre; and, therefore, the
retention being taken away, which is done by the
unfixing of B, there will remain but one endeavour
in B, namely, that in the tangent B C. Wherefore
the motion of the body B unfixed will proceed in
the tangent B C; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this demonstration it is manifest, that circular
motion about an unmoved axis shakes off and
puts further from the centre of its motion such
things as touch, but do not stick fast to its superficies;
and the more, by how much the distance is
greater from the poles of the circular motion; and
so much the more also, by how much the things,
that are shaken off, are less driven towards the
centre by the fluid ambient, for other causes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Such things as are moved with simple circular motion, beget simple circular motion.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art21.10'></a>10. If in a fluid medium a spherical body be
moved with simple circular motion, and in the same
medium there float another sphere whose matter is
not fluid, this sphere also shall be moved with simple
circular motion.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig21.5'></a>Let B C D (in <a href='#fig21.f5'>fig. 5</a>) be a circle, whose centre is
A, and in whose circumference there is a sphere
so moved, that it describes with simple motion <a id='corr329.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='the the'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_329.29'><ins class='correction' title='the the'>the</ins></a></span>
perimeter B C D. Let also E F G be another
sphere of consistent matter, whose semidiameter is
E H, and centre H; and with the radius A H let
the circle H I be described. I say, the sphere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>E F G will, by the motion of the body in B C D,
be moved in the circumference H I with simple
motion.</p>

<p class='c001'>For seeing the motion in B C D (by <a href='#art21.4'>art. 4</a> of this
chapter) makes all the points of the fluid medium
describe in the same time circular lines equal to
one another, the points E, H and G of the strait
line E H G will in the same time describe with equal
radii equal circles. Let E B be drawn equal and
parallel to the strait line A H; and let A B be connected,
which will therefore be equal and parallel
to E H; and therefore also, if upon the centre B
and radius B E the arch E K be drawn equal to the
arch H I, and the strait lines A I, B K and I K be
drawn, B K and A I will be equal; and they will
also be parallel, because the two arches E K and
H I, that is, the two angles K B E and I A H are
equal; and, consequently, the strait lines A B
and K I, which connect them, will also be equal
and parallel. Wherefore K I and E H are parallel.
Seeing, therefore, E and H are carried in the same
time to K and I, the whole strait line I K will be
parallel to E H, from whence it departed. And,
therefore, seeing the sphere E F G is supposed to
be of consistent matter, so as all its points keep
always the same situation, it is necessary that every
other strait line, taken in the same sphere, be carried
always parallel to the places in which it formerly
was. Wherefore the sphere E F G is moved
with simple circular motion; which was to be
demonstrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If that which is so moved have one side hard and the other side fluid, its motion will not be perfectly circular.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art21.11'></a>11. If in a fluid medium, whose parts are stirred
by a body moved with simple motion, there float
another body, which hath its superficies either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>wholly hard, or wholly fluid, the parts of this body
shall approach the centre equally on all sides; that
is to say, the motion of the body shall be circular,
and concentric with the motion of the movent.
But if it have one side hard, and the other side
fluid, then both those motions shall not have the
same centre, nor shall the floating body be moved
in the circumference of a perfect circle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let a body be moved in the circumference of the
circle K L M N (in <a href='#fig21.f2'>fig 2.</a>) whose centre is A. And
let there be another body at I, whose superficies is
either all hard or all fluid. Also let the medium, in
which both these bodies are placed, be fluid. I
say, the body at I will be moved in the circle I B
about the centre A. For this has been demonstrated
in the <a href='#art21.10'>last article</a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wherefore let the superficies of the body at I be
fluid on one side, and hard on the other. And
first, let the fluid side be towards the centre. Seeing,
therefore, the motion of the medium is such,
as that its parts do continually change their places,
(as hath been shown in <a href='#art21.5'>art 5</a>); if this change of
place be considered in those parts of the medium
which are contiguous to the fluid superficies, it must
needs be that the small parts of that superficies
enter into the places of the small parts of the medium
which are contiguous to them; and the like
change of place will be made with the next contiguous
parts towards A. And if the fluid parts of
the body at I have any degree at all of tenacity (for
there are degrees of tenacity, as in the air and
water) the whole fluid side will be lifted up a little,
but so much the less, as its parts have less tenacity;
whereas the hard part of the superficies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>which is contiguous to the fluid part, has no cause
at all of elevation, that is to say, no endeavour
towards A.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, let the hard superficies of the body at
I be towards A. By reason, therefore, of the said
change of place of the parts which are contiguous
to it, the hard superficies must, of necessity, seeing
by supposition there is no empty space, either come
nearer to A, or else its smallest parts must supply
the contiguous places of the medium, which otherwise
would be empty. But this cannot be, by reason
of the supposed hardness; and, therefore, the
other must needs be, namely, that the body come
nearer to A. Wherefore the body at I has greater
endeavour towards the centre A, when its hard
side is next it, than when it is averted from it.
But the body in I, while it is moving in the circumference
of the circle I B, has sometimes one side,
sometimes another, turned towards the centre; and,
therefore, it is sometimes nearer, sometimes further
off from the centre A. Wherefore the body
at I is not carried in the circumference of a perfect
circle; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Endeavour and pressure how they differ.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.1'></a>1. I have already (chapter <span class='fss'>XV</span>. <a href='#art15.2'>art. 2</a>) defined
endeavour to be motion through some length,
though not considered as length, but as a point.
Whether, therefore, there be resistance or no resistance,
the endeavour will still be the same. For
simply to endeavour is to go. But when two bodies,
having opposite endeavours, press one another, then
the endeavour of either of them is that which we
call pressure, and is mutual when their pressures
are opposite.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Two kinds of mediums in which bodies are moved.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span><a id='art22.2'></a>2. Bodies moved, and also the mediums in which
they are moved, are of two kinds. For either they
have their parts coherent in such manner, as no
part of the moved body will easily yield to the
movent, except the whole body yield also, and such
are the things we call <em>hard</em>: or else their parts,
while the whole remains unmoved, will easily yield
to the movent, and these we call <em>fluid</em> or <em>soft</em>
bodies. For the words <em>fluid</em>, <em>soft</em>, <em>tough</em>, and <em>hard</em>,
in the same manner as <em>great</em> and <em>little</em>, are used
only comparatively; and are not different kinds,
but different degrees of quality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Propagation of motion, what it is.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.3'></a>3. To <em>do</em>, and to <em>suffer</em>, is to move and to be
moved; and nothing is moved but by that which
toucheth it and is also moved, as has been formerly
shown. And how great soever the distance be,
we say the first movent moveth the last moved
body, but mediately; namely so, as that the first
moveth the second, the second the third, and so
on, till the last of all be touched. When therefore
one body, having opposite endeavour to another
body, moveth the same, and that moveth a
third, and so on, I call that action <em>propagation of
motion</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What motion bodies have when they press one another.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.4'></a>4. When two fluid bodies, which are in a free
and open space, press one another, their parts will
endeavour, or be moved, towards the sides; not
only those parts which are there where the mutual
contact is, but all the other parts. For in the first
contact, the parts, which are pressed by both the
endeavouring bodies, have no place either forwards
or backwards in which they can be moved; and
therefore they are pressed out towards the sides.
And this expressure, when the forces are equal, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>in a line perpendicular to the bodies pressing. But
whensoever the foremost parts of both the bodies
are pressed, the hindermost also must be pressed
at the same time; for the motion of the hindermost
parts cannot in an instant be stopped by the
resistance of the foremost parts, but proceeds for
some time; and therefore, seeing they must have
some place in which they may be moved, and that
there is no place at all for them forwards, it is necessary
that they be moved into the places which are
towards the sides every way. And this effect follows
of necessity, not only in fluid, but in consistent
and hard bodies, though it be not always manifest
to sense. For though from the compression of
two stones we cannot with our eyes discern any
swelling outwards towards the sides, as we perceive
in two bodies of wax; yet we know well
enough by reason, that some tumour must needs be
there, though it be but little.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fluid bodies, when they are pressed together, penetrate one another.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.5'></a>5. But when the space is enclosed, and both the
bodies be fluid, they will, if they be pressed together,
penetrate one another, though differently,
according to their different endeavours. For suppose
a hollow cylinder of hard matter, well
stopped at both ends, but filled first, below with
some heavy fluid body, as quicksilver, and above
with water or air. If now the bottom of the
cylinder be turned upwards, the heaviest fluid
body, which is now at the top, having the greatest
endeavour downwards, and being by the hard
sides of the vessel hindered from extending itself
sideways, must of necessity either be received by
the lighter body, that it may sink through it, or
else it must open a passage through itself, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>which the lighter body may ascend. For of the
two bodies, that, whose parts are most easily separated,
will be the first divided; which being done,
it is not necessary that the parts of the other suffer
any separation at all. And therefore when two
liquors, which are enclosed in the same vessel,
change their places, there is no need that their
smallest parts should be mingled with one another;
for a way being opened through one of them, the
parts of the other need not be separated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now if a fluid body, which is not enclosed, press
a hard body, its endeavour will indeed be towards
the internal parts of that hard body; but being
excluded by the resistance of it, the parts of the
fluid body will be moved every way according to
the superficies of the hard body, and that equally,
if the pressure be perpendicular; for when all the
parts of the cause are equal, the effects will be
equal also. But if the pressure be not perpendicular,
then the angles of the incidence being unequal,
the expansion also will be unequal, namely,
greater on that side where the angle is greater,
because that motion is most direct which proceeds
by the directest line.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>When one body presseth another and doth not penetrate it, the action of the pressing body is perpendicular to the superficies of the body pressed.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.6'></a>6. If a body, pressing another body, do not
penetrate it, it will nevertheless give to the part it
presseth an endeavour to yield, and recede in a
strait line perpendicular to its superficies in that
point in which it is pressed.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig22.1'></a>Let A B C D (in <a href='#fig22.f1'>fig. 1</a>) be a hard body, and let
another body, falling upon it in the strait line E A,
with any inclination or without inclination, press
it in the point A. I say the body so pressing, and
not penetrating it, will give to the part A an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>endeavour to yield or recede in a strait line perpendicular
to the line A D.</p>

<p class='c001'>For let A B be perpendicular to A D, and let
B A be produced to F. If therefore A F be coincident
with A E, it is of itself manifest that the
motion in E A will make A to endeavour in the
line A B. Let now E A be oblique to A D, and
from the point E let the strait line E C be drawn,
cutting A D at right angles in D, and let the
rectangles A B C D and A D E F be completed. I
have shown (in the <a href='#art16.8'>8th article</a> of chapter <span class='fss'>XVI</span>)
that the body will be carried from E to A by the
concourse of two uniform motions, the one in E F
and its parallels, the other in E D and its parallels.
But the motion in E F and its parallels, whereof
D A is one, contributes nothing to the body in A
to make it endeavour or press towards B; and
therefore the whole endeavour, which the body
hath in the inclined line E A to pass or press the
strait line A D, it hath it all from the perpendicular
motion or endeavour in F A. Wherefore the body
E, after it is in A, will have only that perpendicular
endeavour which proceeds from the motion in
F A, that is, in A B; which was to be proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>When a hard body, pressing another body, penetrates the same, it doth not penetrate it perpendicularly, unless it fall perpendicularly upon it.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.7'></a>7. If a hard body falling upon or pressing another
body penetrate the same, its endeavour
after its first penetration will be neither in the
inclined line produced, nor in the perpendicular,
but sometimes betwixt both, sometimes without
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let E A G (in the same <a href='#fig22.f1'>fig. 1</a>) be the inclined
line produced; and first, let the passage through
the medium, in which E A is, be easier than the
passage through the medium in which A G is. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>soon therefore as the body is within the medium
in which is A G, it will find greater resistance to
its motion in D A and its parallels, than it did
whilst it was above A D; and therefore below A D
it will proceed with slower motion in the parallels
of D A, than above it. Wherefore the motion
which is compounded of the two motions in E F
and E D will be slower below A D than above it;
and therefore also, the body will not proceed from
A in E A produced, but below it. Seeing, therefore,
the endeavour in A B is generated by the
endeavour in F A; if to the endeavour in F A there
be added the endeavour in D A, which is not all
taken away by the immersion of the point A into
the lower medium, the body will not proceed from
A in the perpendicular A B, but beyond it; namely,
in some strait line between A B and A G, as in the
line A H.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, let the passage through the medium E A
be less easy than that through A G. The motion,
therefore, which is made by the concourse of the
motions in E F and F B, is slower above A D than
below it; and consequently, the endeavour will
not proceed from A in E A produced, but beyond
it, as in A I. Wherefore, if a hard body falling,
&#38;c.; which was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>This divergency of the strait line A H from the
strait line A G is that which, the writers of optics
commonly called <em>refraction</em>, which, when the passage
is easier in the first than in the second
medium, is made by diverging from the line of
inclination towards the perpendicular; and contrarily,
when the passage is not so easy in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>first medium, by departing further from the perpendicular.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Motion sometimes opposite to that of the movent.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.8'></a>8. By the 6th theorem it is manifest, that the
force of the movent may be so placed, as that
the body moved by it may proceed in a way almost
directly contrary to that of the movent, as we see
in the motion of ships.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig22.2'></a>For let A B (in <a href='#fig22.f2'>fig. 2</a>) represent a ship, whose
length from the prow to the poop is A B, and let
the wind lie upon it in the strait parallel lines C B,
D E and F G; and let D E and F G be cut in E <a id='corr339.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='and and'>and</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_339.11'><ins class='correction' title='and and'>and</ins></a></span>
G by a strait line drawn from B perpendicular
to A B; also let B E and E G be equal, and the
angle A B C any angle how small soever. Then
between B C and B A let the strait line B I be
drawn; and let the sail be conceived to be spread
in the same line B I, and the wind to fall upon it
in the points L, M and B; from which points, perpendicular
to B I, let B K, M Q and L P be drawn.
Lastly, let E N and G O be drawn perpendicular to
B G, and cutting B K in H and K; and let H N
and K O be made equal to one another, and severally
equal to B A. I say, the ship B A, by the
wind falling upon it in C B, D E, F G, and other
lines parallel to them, will be carried forwards
almost opposite to the wind, that is to say, in a
way almost contrary to the way of the movent.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the wind that blows in the line C B will (as
hath been shown in <a href='#art22.6'>art. 6</a>) give to the point B an endeavour
to proceed in a strait line perpendicular to
the strait line B I, that is, in the strait line B K;
and to the points M and L an endeavour to proceed
in the strait lines M Q and L P, which are
parallel to B K. Let now the measure of the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>be B G, which is divided in the middle in E; and
let the point B be carried to H in the time B E.
In the same time, therefore, by the wind blowing
in D M and F L, and as many other lines as may
be drawn parallel to them, the whole ship will be
applied to the strait line H N. Also at the end of
the second time E G, it will be applied to the strait
line K O. Wherefore the ship will always go forward;
and the angle it makes with the wind will
be equal to the angle A B C, how small soever that
angle be; and the way it makes will in every time be
equal to the strait line E H. I say, thus it would
be, if the ship might be moved with as great
celerity sideways from B A towards K O, as it may
be moved forwards in the line B A. But this is
impossible, by reason of the resistance made by the
great quantity of water which presseth the side, much
exceeding the resistance made by the much smaller
quantity which presseth the prow of the ship; so
that the way the ship makes sideways is scarce
sensible; and, therefore, the point B will proceed
almost in the very line B A, making with the wind
the angle A B C, how acute soever; that is to say,
it will proceed almost in the strait line B C, that
is, in a way almost contrary to the way of the
movent; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the sail in B I must be so stretched as that
there be left in it no bosom at all; for otherwise
the strait lines L P, M Q and B K will not be perpendicular
to the plane of the sail, but falling below
P, Q and K, will drive the ship backwards. But
by making use of a small board for a sail, a little
waggon with wheels for the ship, and of a smooth
pavement for the sea, I have by experience found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>this to be so true, that I could scarce oppose the
board to the wind in any obliquity, though never
so small, but the waggon was carried forwards
by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the same 6th theorem it may be found, how
much a stroke, which falls obliquely, is weaker than
a stroke falling perpendicularly, they being like
and equal in all other respects.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig22.3'></a>Let a stroke fall upon the wall A B obliquely, as
for example, in the strait line C A (in <a href='#fig22.f3'>fig. 3.</a>) Let
C E be drawn parallel to A B, and D A perpendicular
to the same A B and equal to C A; and let
both the velocity and time of the motion in C A be
equal to the velocity and time of the motion in
D A. I say, the stroke in C A will be weaker than
that in D A, in the proportion of E A to D A. For
producing D A howsoever to F, the endeavour of
both the strokes will (by <a href='#art22.6'>art. 6</a>) proceed from A
in the perpendicular A F. But the stroke in C A is
made by the concourse of two motions in C E and
E A, of which that in C E contributes nothing to
the stroke in A, because C E and B A are parallels;
and, therefore, the stroke in C A is made by the
motion which is in E A only. But the velocity or
force of the perpendicular stroke in E A, to the
velocity or force of the stroke in D A, is as E A to
D A. Wherefore the oblique stroke in C A is weaker
than the perpendicular stroke in D A, in the proportion
of E A to D A or C A; which was to be
proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In a full medium, motion is propagated to any distance.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.9'></a>9. In a full medium, all endeavour proceeds as
far as the medium itself reacheth; that is to say, if
the medium be infinite, the endeavour will proceed
infinitely.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>For whatsoever endeavoureth is moved, and
therefore whatsoever standeth in its way it maketh
it yield, at least a little, namely, so far as the movent
itself is moved forwards. But that which yieldeth
is also moved, and consequently maketh that to yield
which is in its way, and so on successively as long
as the medium is full; that is to say, infinitely, if
the full medium be infinite; which was to be
proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now although endeavour thus perpetually propagated
do not always appear to the senses as
motion, yet it appears as action, or as the efficient
cause of some mutation. For if there be placed
before our eyes some very little object, as for
example, a small grain of sand, which at a certain
distance is visible; it is manifest that it may be removed
to such a distance as not to be any longer
seen, though by its action it still work upon the
organs of sight, as is manifest from that which was
last proved, that all endeavour proceeds infinitely.
Let it be conceived therefore to be removed from
our eyes to any distance how great soever, and a
sufficient number of other grains of sand of the
same bigness added to it; it is evident that the
aggregate of all those sands will be visible; and
though none of them can be seen when it is single
and severed from the rest, yet the whole heap or
hill which they make will manifestly appear to the
sight; which would be impossible, if some action
did not proceed from each several part of the whole
heap.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dilatation &#38; contraction what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.10'></a>10. Between the degrees of hard and soft are
those things which we call <em>tough</em>, tough being that
which may be bent without being altered from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>what it was; and the bending of a line is either
the adduction or diduction of the extreme parts,
that is, a motion from straitness to crookedness,
or contrarily, whilst the line remains still the same
it was; for by drawing out the extreme points of
a line to their greatest distance, the line is made
strait, which otherwise is crooked. So also the
bending of a superficies is the diduction or adduction
of its extreme lines, that is, their dilatation and
contraction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dilatation &#38; contraction suppose mutation of the smallest parts in respect of their situation.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.11'></a>11. <em>Dilatation</em> and <em>contraction</em>, as also all <em>flexion</em>,
supposes necessarily that the internal parts of the
body bowed do either come nearer to the external
parts, or go further from them. For though <em>flexion</em>
be considered only in the length of a body, yet
when that body is bowed, the line which is made
on one side will be convex, and the line on the
other side will be concave; of which the concave,
being the interior line, will, unless something be
taken from it and added to the convex line, be the
more crooked, that is, the greater of the two.
But they are equal; and, therefore, in flexion there
is an accession made from the interior to the exterior
parts; and, on the contrary, in tension, from
the exterior to the interior parts. And as for those
things which do not easily suffer such transposition
of their parts, they are called brittle; and the
great force they require to make them yield, makes
them also with sudden motion to leap asunder, and
break in pieces.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>All traction is pulsion.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.12'></a>12. Also motion is distinguished into <em>pulsion</em>
and <em>traction</em>. And pulsion, as I have already defined
it, is when that which is moved goes before
that which moveth it. But contrarily, in traction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>the movent goes before that which is moved. Nevertheless,
considering it with greater attention, it
seemeth to be the same with pulsion. For of two
parts of a hard body, when that which is foremost
drives before it the medium in which the motion is
made, at the same time that which is thrust forwards
thrusteth the next, and this again the next,
and so on successively. In which action, if we suppose
that there is no place void, it must needs be,
that by continual pulsion, namely, when that action
has gone round, the movent will be behind that
part, which at the first seemed not to be thrust
forwards, but to be drawn; so that now the body,
which was drawn, goes before the body which
gives it motion; and its motion is no longer traction,
but pulsion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Such things as being pressed or bent restore themselves, have motion in their internal parts.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.13'></a>13. Such things as are removed from their
places by forcible compression or extension, and, as
soon as the force is taken away, do presently return
and restore themselves to their former situation,
have the beginning of their restitution within themselves,
namely, a certain motion in their internal
parts, which was there, when, before the taking
away of the force, they were compressed, or extended.
For that restitution is motion, and that
which is at rest cannot be moved, but by a moved
and a contiguous movent. Nor doth the cause of
their restitution proceed from the taking away of
the force by which they were compressed or extended;
for the removing of impediments hath not
the efficacy of a cause, as has been shown at the
end of the <a href='#art15.3'>3rd article</a> of chap. <span class='fss'>XV</span>. The cause
therefore of their restitution is some motion either
of the parts of the ambient, or of the parts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>body compressed or extended. But the parts of
the ambient have no endeavour which contributes
to their compression or extension, nor to the setting
of them at liberty, or restitution. It remains
therefore that from the time of their compression or
extension there be left some endeavour or motion,
by which, the impediment being removed, every
part resumes its former place; that is to say, the
whole restores itself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Though that which carrieth another be stopped, the body carried will proceed.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.14'></a>14. In the carriage of bodies, if that body, which
carries another, hit upon any obstacle, or be by
any means suddenly stopped, and that which is
carried be not stopped, it will go on, till its motion
be by some external impediment taken away.</p>

<p class='c001'>For I have demonstrated (chap. <span class='fss'>VIII</span>, <a href='#art8.19'>art. 19</a>)
that motion, unless it be hindered by some external
resistance, will be continued eternally with the
same celerity; and in the <a href='#art9.7'>7th article</a> of chap. <span class='fss'>IX</span>,
that the action of an external agent is of no effect
without contact. When therefore that, which carrieth
another thing, is stopped, that stop doth not
presently take away the motion of that which is
carried. It will therefore proceed, till its motion
be by little and little extinguished by some external
resistance: which was to be proved; though experience
alone had been sufficient to prove this.</p>

<p class='c001'>In like manner, if that body which carrieth
another be put from rest into sudden motion, that
which is carried will not be moved forwards together
with it, but will be left behind. For the contiguous
part of the body carried hath almost the
same motion with the body which carries it; and
the remote parts will receive different velocities
according to their different distances from the body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>that carries them; namely, the more remote the
parts are, the less will be their degrees of velocity.
It is necessary, therefore, that the body, which is
carried, be left accordingly more or less behind.
And this also is manifest by experience, when at
the starting forward of the horse the rider falleth
backwards.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The effects of percussion not to be compared with those of weight.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.15'></a>15. In <em>percussion</em>, therefore, when one hard
body is in some small part of it stricken by another
with great force, it is not necessary that the whole
body should yield to the stroke with the same
celerity with which the stricken part yields. For
the rest of the parts receive their motion from the
motion of the part stricken and yielding, which
motion is less propagated every way towards the
sides, than it is directly forwards. And hence it
is, that sometimes very hard bodies, which being
erected can hardly be made to stand, are more
easily broken than thrown down by a violent
stroke; when, nevertheless, if all their parts together
were by any weak motion thrust forwards,
they would easily be cast down.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.16'></a>16. Though the difference between <em>trusion</em> and
<em>percussion</em> consist only in this, that in trusion the
motion both of the movent and moved body begin
both together in their very contact; and in percussion
the striking body is first moved, and afterwards
the body stricken; yet their effects are so
different, that it seems scarce possible to compare
their forces with one another. I say, any effect of
percussion being propounded, as for example, the
stroke of a beetle of any weight assigned, by
which a pile of any given length is to be driven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>into earth of any tenacity given, it seems to me
very hard, if not impossible, to define with what
weight, or with what stroke, and in what time, the
same pile may be driven to a depth assigned into
the same earth. The cause of which difficulty is
this, that the velocity of the percutient is to be
compared with the magnitude of the ponderant.
Now velocity, seeing it is computed by the length
of space transmitted, is to be accounted but as one
dimension; but weight is as a solid thing, being
measured by the dimension of the whole body.
And there is no comparison to be made of a solid
body with a length, that is, with a line.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Motion cannot begin first in the internal parts of a body.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.17'></a>17. If the internal parts of a body be at rest, or
retain the same situation with one another for any
time how little soever, there cannot in those parts
be generated any new motion or endeavour, whereof
the efficient cause is not without the body of which
they are parts. For if any small part, which is
comprehended within the superficies of the whole
body, be supposed to be now at rest, and by and
by to be moved, that part must of necessity receive
its motion from some moved and contiguous body.
But by supposition, there is no such moved and
contiguous part within the body. Wherefore, if
there be any endeavour or motion or change of
situation in the internal parts of that body, it must
needs arise from some efficient cause that is
without the body which contains them; which was
to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.18'></a>18. In hard bodies, therefore, which are compressed
or extended, if, that which compresseth or
extendeth them being taken away, they restore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>themselves to their former place or situation, it
must needs be that that endeavour or motion of
their internal parts, by which they were able to
recover their former places or situations, was not
extinguished when the force by which they were
compressed or extended was taken away. Therefore,
when the lath of a cross-bow bent doth, as
soon as it is at liberty, restore itself, though to him,
that judges by sense, both it and all its parts seem
to be at rest; yet he, that judging by reason doth
not account the taking away of impediment for an
efficient cause, nor conceives that without an efficient
cause any thing can pass from rest to motion,
will conclude that the parts were already in motion
before they began to restore themselves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Action and reaction proceed in the same line.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.19'></a>19. <em>Action</em> and <em>reaction</em> proceed in the same
line, but from opposite terms. For seeing reaction is
nothing but endeavour in the patient to restore itself
to that situation from which it was forced by the
agent; the endeavour or motion both of the agent
and patient or reagent will be propagated between
the same terms; yet so, as that in action the term,
<em>from which</em>, is in reaction the term <em>to which</em>. And
seeing all action proceeds in this manner, not only
between the opposite terms of the whole line in
which it is propagated, but also in all the parts of
that line, the terms <em>from which</em> and <em>to which</em>, both
of the action and reaction, will be in the same line.
Wherefore action and reaction proceed in the same
line, &#38;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Habit, what it is.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art22.20'></a>20. To what has been said of motion, I will add
what I have to say concerning habit. <em>Habit</em>,
therefore, is a generation of motion, not of motion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>simply, but an easy conducting of the moved body
in a certain and designed way. And seeing it is
attained by the weakening of such endeavours as
divert its motion, therefore such endeavours are
to be weakened by little and little. But this cannot
be done but by the long continuance of action, or
by actions often repeated; and therefore custom
begets that facility, which is commonly and rightly
called <em>habit</em>; and it may be defined thus: <span class='fss'>HABIT</span>
<i>is motion made more easy and ready by custom;
that is to say, by perpetual endeavour, or by
iterated endeavours in a way differing from that
in which the motion proceeded from the beginning,
and opposing such endeavours as resist</i>. And to
make this more perspicuous by example, we may
observe, that when one that has no skill in music
first puts his hand to an instrument, he cannot
after the first stroke carry his hand to the place
where he would make the second stroke, without
taking it back by a new endeavour, and, as it were
beginning again, pass from the first to the second.
Nor will he be able to go on to the third place
without another new endeavour; but he will be
forced to draw back his hand again, and so successively,
by renewing his endeavour at every
stroke; till at the last, by doing this often, and by
compounding many interrupted motions or endeavours
into one equal endeavour, he be able to make
his hand go readily on from stroke to stroke in
that order and way which was at the first designed.
Nor are habits to be observed in living creatures
only, but also in bodies inanimate. For we find
that when the lath of a cross-bow is strongly bent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>and would if the impediment were removed return
again with great force; if it remain a long time
bent, it will get such a habit, that when it is loosed
and left to its own freedom, it will not only not
restore itself, but will require as much force for
the bringing of it back to its first posture, as it did
for the bending of it at the first.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='fss'>I.</span> A <em>scale</em> is a strait line, whose middle point
is immovable, all the rest of its points being at
liberty; and that part of the scale, which reaches
from the centre to either of the weights, is called
the <em>beam</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='fss'>II.</span> <em>Equiponderation</em> is when the endeavour of
one body, which presses one of the beams, resists
the endeavour of another body pressing the other
beam, so that neither of them is moved; and the
bodies, when neither of them is moved, are said to
be <em>equally poised</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='fss'>III.</span> <em>Weight</em> is the aggregate of all the endeavours,
by which all the points of that body, which
presses the beam, tend downwards in lines parallel
to one another; and the body which presses is
called the <em>ponderant</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='fss'>IV.</span> <em>Moment</em> is the power which the ponderant
has to move the beam, by reason of a determined

For the effect of the ponderant D, in the point B,
is circular motion in the arch B H; and the effect
of the ponderant E, in the point C, circular motion
in the arch C I; and by reason of the equality of
the ponderants D and E, these motions are to one

the proportion of the moment of the ponderant C

be proportional to the moments of C and D. For
the moment of C is B G, and the moment of D is
E I, to which K L is equal. But as the distance
A B from the centre is to the distance A L from

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Let the centre of the scale (in the same <a href='#fig23.f3'>third figure</a>) be A, the beam A B; and let any ponderant

moment is E I, be applied to the point E. Through
the point I let I K be drawn parallel to the beam
A B, cutting A G in K; also let K L be drawn
parallel to B G, K L will then be the moment of the

B G, the moment of the ponderant C in the point
B, to L K the moment of the ponderant D in the
point E, so A B to A L. On the other side of the
centre of the scale, let A N be taken equal to A L;
and to the point N let there be applied the ponderant
O, having to the ponderant C the proportion
of A B to A N. I say, the ponderants in B and N
will be equally poised. For the proportion of the
moment of the ponderant O, in the point N, to the
moment of the ponderant C in the point B, is by
the <a href='#art23.5'>5th article</a>, compounded of the proportions of
the weight O to the weight C, and of the distance
from the centre of the scale A N or A L to the
distance from the centre of the scale A B. But
seeing we have supposed, that the distance A B
to the distance A N is in reciprocal proportion
of the weight O to the weight C, the proportion
of the moment of the ponderant O, in the point
N, to the moment of the ponderant C, in the point
B, will be compounded of the proportions of A B
to A N, and of A N to A B. Wherefore, setting in
order A B, A N, A B, the moment of O to the moment
of C will be as the first to the last, that is, as
A B to A B. Their moments therefore are equal;
and consequently the plane which passes through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>A will (by the fifth definition) be a plane of equiponderation.
Wherefore they will be equally
poised; as was to be proved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the converse of this is manifest. For if
there be equiponderation and the proportion of the
weights and distances be not reciprocal, then both
the weights will always have the same moments,
although one of them have more weight added to
it or its distance changed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. When ponderants are of the same species,
and their moments be equal; their magnitudes and
distances from the centre of the scale will be reciprocally
proportional. For in homogeneous bodies,
it is as weight to weight, so magnitude to magnitude.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If the parts of any ponderant press the beams of the scale every where equally, all the parts cut off, reckoned from centre of the scale, will have their moments in the same proportion with that of the parts of a triangle cut off from the vertex by strait lines parallel to the base.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art23.8'></a>8. If to the whole length of the beam there be
applied a parallelogram, or a parallelopipedum, or
a prisma, or a cylinder, or the superficies of a
cylinder, or of a sphere, or of any portion of a
sphere or prisma; the parts of any of them cut
off with planes parallel to the base will have their
moments in the same proportion with the parts of
a triangle, which has its vertex in the centre of the
scale, and for one of its sides the beam itself, which
parts are cut off by planes parallel to the base.</p>

<p class='c001'>First, <a id='fig23.4'></a>let the rectangled parallelogram A B C D
(in <a href='#fig23.f4'>figure 4</a>) be applied to the whole length of
the beam A B; and producing C B howsoever to E,
let the triangle A B E be described. Let now any
part of the parallelogram, as A F, be cut off by the
plane F G, parallel to the base C B; and let F G be
produced to A E in the point H. I say, the moment
of the whole A B C D to the moment of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>part A F, is as the triangle A B E to the triangle
A G H, that is, in proportion duplicate to that of
the distances from the centre of the scale.</p>

<p class='c001'>For, the parallelogram A B C D being divided
into equal parts, infinite in number, by strait lines
drawn parallel to the base; and supposing the
moment of the strait line C B to be B E, the moment
of the strait line F G will (by the <a href='#art23.7'>7th article</a>)
be G H; and the moments of all the strait lines of
that parallelogram will be so many strait lines in
the triangle A B E drawn parallel to the base B E;
all which parallels together taken are the moment
of the whole parallelogram A B C D; and the same
parallels do also constitute the superficies of the
triangle A B E. Wherefore the moment of the
parallelogram A B C D is the triangle A B E; and
for the same reason, the moment of the parallelogram
A F is the triangle A G H; and therefore the
moment of the whole parallelogram to the moment
of a parallelogram which is part of the same, is as
the triangle A B E to the triangle A G H, or in
proportion duplicate to that of the beams to which
they are applied. And what is here demonstrated
in the case of a parallelogram may be understood
to serve for that of a cylinder, and of a prisma,
and their superficies; as also for the superficies of
a sphere, of an hemisphere, or any portion of a
sphere. For the parts of the superficies of a sphere
have the same proportion with that of the parts of
the axis cut off by the same parallels, by which the
parts of the superficies are cut off, as Archimedes
has demonstrated; and therefore when the parts
of any of these figures are equal and at equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>distances from the centre of the scale, their moments
also are equal, in the same manner as they
are in parallelograms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, let the parallelogram A K I B not be
rectangled; the strait line I B will nevertheless
press the point B perpendicularly in the strait line
B E; and the strait line L G will press the point
G perpendicularly in the strait line G H; and all
the rest of the strait lines which are parallel to I B
will do the like. Whatsoever therefore the moment
be which is assigned to the strait line I B, as here,
for example, it is supposed to be B E, if A E be
drawn, the moment of the whole parallelogram A I
will be the triangle A B E; and the moment of the
part A L will be the triangle A G H. Wherefore
the moment of any ponderant, which has its sides
equally applied to the beam, whether they be
applied perpendicularly or obliquely, will be always
to the moment of a part of the same in such proportion
as the whole triangle has to a part of the
same cut off by a plane which is parallel to the base.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The diameter of equiponderation of figures which are deficient according to commensurable proportions of their altitudes and bases, divides the axis, so that the part taken next the vertex is to the other part as the complete figure to the deficient figure.</div>

which is deficient according to commensurable

and whose complete figure is either a parallelogram

figure.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig23.5'></a>For let C I A P E (in <a href='#fig23.f5'>fig. 5</a>) be a deficient figure,
whose axis is A B, and whose complete figure is

that A Z be to Z B as C D F E is to C I A P E. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>say, the centre of equiponderation of the figure
C I A P E will be in the point Z.</p>

<p class='c001'>First, that the centre of equiponderation of the
figure C I A P E is somewhere in the axis A B is
manifest of itself; and therefore A B is a diameter
of equiponderation. Let A E be drawn, and let
B E be put for the moment of the strait line C E;
the triangle A B E will therefore (by the <a href='#art23.3'>third article</a>) be the moment of the complete figure
C D F E. Let the axis A B be equally divided in
L, and let G L H be drawn parallel and equal to
the strait line C E, cutting the crooked line
C I A P E in I and P, and the strait lines A C and
A E in K and M. Moreover, let Z O be drawn
parallel to the same C E; and let it be, as L G to
L I, so L M to another, L N; and let the same be
done in all the rest of the strait lines possible,
parallel to the base; and through all the points N,
let the line A N E be drawn; the three-sided figure
A N E B will therefore be the moment of the figure
C I A P E. Now the triangle A B E is (by the
<a href='#art17.9'>9th article</a> of chapter XVII) to the three-sided
figure A N E B, as A B C D + A I C B is to A I C B
twice taken, that is, as C D F E + C I A P E is to
C I A P E twice taken. But as C I A P E is to
C D F E, that is, as the weight of the deficient
figure is to the weight of the complete figure, so is
C I A P E twice taken to C D F E twice taken.
Wherefore, setting in order C D F E + C I A P E.
2 C I A P E. 2 C D F E; the proportion of C D F E +
C I A P E to C D F E twice taken will be compounded
of the proportion of C D F E + C I A P E
to C I A P E twice taken, that is, of the proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>of the triangle A B E to the three-sided figure
A N E B, that is, of the moment of the complete
figure to the moment of the deficient figure, and of
the proportion of C I A P E twice taken to C D F E
twice taken, that is, to the proportion reciprocally
taken of the weight of the deficient figure to the
weight of the complete figure.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, seeing by supposition A Z. Z B:: C D F E.
C I A P E are proportionals; A B. A Z:: C D F E +
C I A P E. C D F E will also, by compounding, be
proportionals. And seeing A L is the half of A B,
A L. A Z:: C D F E + C I A P E. 2 C D F E will also
be proportionals. But the proportion of C D F E +
C I A P E to 2 C D F E is compounded, as was but
now shown, of the proportions of moment to moment,
&#38;c., and therefore the proportion of A L to
A Z is compounded of the proportion of the moment
of the complete figure C D F E to the moment
of the deficient figure C I A P E, and of the proportion
of the weight of the deficient figure C I A P E
to the weight of the complete figure C D F E; but
the proportion of A L to A Z is compounded of the
proportions of A L to B Z and of B Z to A Z. Now
the proportion of B Z to A Z is the proportion of
the weights reciprocally taken, that is to say, of the
weight C I A P E to the weight C D F E. Therefore
the remaining proportion of A L to B Z, that
is, of L B to B Z, is the proportion of the moment
of the weight C D F E to the moment of the weight
C I A P E. But the proportion of A L to B Z is
compounded of the proportions of A L to A Z and
of A Z to Z B; of which proportions that of A Z to
Z B is the proportion of the weight C D F E to the
weight C I A P E. Wherefore (by <a href='#art23.5'>art. 5</a> of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>chapter) the remaining proportion of A L to A Z is
the proportion of the distances of the points Z and
L from the centre of the scale, which is A. And,
therefore, (by <a href='#art23.6'>art. 6</a>) the weight C I A P E shall hang
from O in the strait line O Z. So that O Z is one
diameter of equiponderation of the weight C I A P E.
But the strait line A B is the other diameter of equiponderation
of the same weight C I A P E. Wherefore
(by the 7th definition) the point Z is the centre
of the same equiponderation; which point, by construction,
divides the axis so, that the part A Z,
which is the part next the vertex, is to the other
part Z B, as the complete figure C D F E is to the
deficient figure C I A P E; which is that which was
to be demonstrated.</p>

taking the denominator of the fraction for the part
of the axis cut off next the vertex, and the numerator
for the other part next the base. For example,
if it be required to find the centre of equiponderation
of the second three-sided figure of four means,
there is in the concourse of the second column
with the row of three-sided figures of four means
this fraction <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub>, which signifies that that figure is
to its parallelogram or complete figure as <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub> to
unity, that is, as <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub> to <sup>7</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub>, or as 5 to 7; and, therefore
the centre of equiponderation of that figure
divides the axis, so that the part next the vertex

exhibited in the same table. For example, if the
centre of equiponderation of a cone be sought for,
the cone will be found to be <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> of its cylinder; and,
therefore, the centre of its equiponderation will so
divide the axis, that the part next the vertex to
the other part will be as 3 to 1. Also the solid of
a three-sided figure of one mean, that is, a parabolical
solid, seeing it is <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>, that is ½ of its cylinder,
will have its centre of equiponderation in that
point, which divides the axis, so that the part

<div class='sidenote'>The diameter of equiponderation of the complement of the half of any of the said deficient figures, divides that line which is drawn through the vertex parallel to the base, so that the part next the vertex is to the other part as the complete figure to the complement.</div>

<p class='c001'>For let A I C B (in the same <a href='#fig23.f5'>fig. 5</a>) be the half

whose axis is A B, and base B C, having A D
drawn from the vertex, equal and parallel to the

A B C D. Let I Q be drawn at any
distance from the side C D, but parallel to it; and
let A D be the altitude of the complement A I C D,
and Q I a line ordinately applied in it. Wherefore
the altitude A L in the deficient figure A I C B is
equal to Q I the line ordinately applied in its complement;
and contrarily, L I the line ordinately
applied in the figure A I C B is equal to the altitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>A Q in its complement; and so in all the rest of
the ordinate lines and altitudes the mutation is
such, that that line, which is ordinately applied in
the figure, is the altitude of its complement. And,
therefore, the proportion of the altitudes decreasing
to that of the ordinate lines decreasing, being
multiplicate according to any number in the deficient
figure, is submultiplicate according to the
same number in its complement. For example, if
A I C B be a parabola, seeing the proportion of
A B to A L is duplicate to that of B C to L I, the
proportion of AD to A Q in the complement A I C D,
which is the same with that of B C to L I, will be
subduplicate to that of C D to Q I, which is the
same with that of A B to A L; and consequently,
in a parabola, the complement will be to the parallelogram
as 1 to 3; in a three-sided figure of
two means, as 1 to 4; in a three-sided figure of
three means, as 1 to 5, &#38;c. But all the ordinate
lines together in A I C D are its moment; and all

the moments of the complements of the halves
of deficient figures in the table of <a href='#art17.3'>art. 3</a> of chap.
<span class='fss'>XVII</span>, being compared, are as the deficient figures
themselves; and, therefore, the diameter of equiponderation

halves may be found by the table of <a href='#art17.3'>art. 3</a> of chap.
<span class='fss'>XVII</span>, in this manner. Let there be propounded
any deficient figure, namely, the second three-sided
figure of two means. This figure is to the complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>figure as <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub> to 1, that is 3 to 5. Wherefore
the complement to the same complete figure is as
2 to 5; and, therefore, the diameter of equiponderation
of this complement will cut the strait
line drawn from the vertex parallel to the base, so
that the part next the vertex will be to the other
part as 5 to 2. And, in like manner, any other of
the said three-sided figures being propounded, if
the numerator of its fraction found out in the table
be taken from the denominator, the strait line
drawn from the vertex is to be divided, so that the
part next the vertex be to the other part, as the
denominator is to the remainder which that subtraction
leaves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The centre of equiponderation of the half of any of the deficient figures in the first row of the table of art. 3, chapter xvii, may be found out by the numbers of the second row.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art23.11'></a>11. The centre of equiponderation of the half of
any of those crooked-lined figures, which are in
the first row of the table of <a href='#art17.3'>art. 3</a> of chap. <span class='fss'>XVII</span>, is
in that strait line which, being parallel to the axis,
divides the base according to the numbers of the
fraction next below it in the second row, so that
the numerator be answerable to that part which is
towards the axis.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig23.6'></a>For example, let the first figure of three means
be taken, whose half is A B C D (in <a href='#fig23.f6'>fig. 6</a>), and let
the rectangle A B E D be completed. The complement
therefore will be B C D E. And seeing
A B E D is to the figure A B C D (by the table) as
5 to 4, the same A B E D will be to the complement
B C D E as 5 to 1. Wherefore, if F G be
drawn parallel to the base D A, cutting the axis so
that A G be to G B as 4 to 5, the centre of equiponderation
of the figure A B C D will, by the precedent
article, be somewhere in the same F G.
Again, seeing, by the same article, the complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>figure A B E D, is to the complement B C D E as
5 to 1, therefore if B E and A D be divided in I
and H as 5 to 1 the centre of equiponderation of
the complement B C D E will be somewhere in the
strait line which connects H and I. Let now the
strait line L K be drawn through M the centre of
the complete figure, parallel to the base; and the
strait line N O through the same centre M, perpendicular
to it; and let the strait lines L K and F G cut
the strait line H I in P and Q. Let P R be taken
quadruple to P Q; and let R M be drawn and produced
to F G in S. R M therefore will be to M S
as 4 to 1, that is, as the figure A B C D to its complement
B C D E. Wherefore, seeing M is the
centre of the complete figure A B E D, and the distances
of R and S from the centre M be in proportion
reciprocal to that of the weight of the complement
B C D E to the weight of the figure A B C D,
R and S will either be the centres of equiponderation
of their own figures, or those centres will be in some
other points of the diameters of equiponderation
H I and F G. But this last is impossible. For no other
strait line can be drawn through the point M terminating
in the strait lines H I and F G, and retaining
the proportion of M R to M S, that is, of the
figure A B C D to its complement B C D E. The
centre, therefore, of equiponderation of the figure
A B C D is in the point S. Now, seeing P M hath
the same proportion to Q S which R P hath to R Q,
Q S will be 5 of those parts of which P M is four,
that is, of which I N is four. But I N or P M is 2
of those parts of which E B or F G is 6; and, therefore,
if it be as 4 to 5, so 2 to a fourth, that fourth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>will be 2½. Wherefore Q S is 2½ of those parts
of which F G is 6. But F Q is 1; and, therefore,
F S is 3½. Wherefore the remaining part G S is 2½.
So that F G is so divided in S, that the part towards
the axis is in proportion to the other part,
as 2½ to 3½, that is as 5 to 7; which answereth to
the fraction <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub> in the second row, next under the
fraction <sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub> in the first row. Wherefore drawing
S T parallel to the axis, the base will be divided in
like manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this method it is manifest, that the base of a
semiparabola will be divided into 3 and 5; and the
base of the first three-sided figure of two means,
into 4 and 6; and of the first three-sided figure of
four means, into 6 and 8. The fractions, therefore,
of the second row denote the proportions,
into which the bases of the figures of the first row
are divided by the diameters of equiponderation.
But the first row begins one place higher than the
second row.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The centre of equiponderation of the half of any of the figures of the second row of the same table may be found out by the numbers of the fourth row.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art23.12'></a>12. The centre of equiponderation of the half of
any of the figures in the second row of the same
table of <a href='#art17.3'>art. 3</a>, chap. <span class='fss'>XVII</span>, is in a strait line parallel
to the axis, and dividing the base according to the
numbers of the fraction in the fourth row, two
places lower, so as that the numerator be answerable
to that part which is next the axis.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig23.7'></a>Let the half of the second three-sided figure of
two means be taken; and let it be A B C D (in
<a href='#fig23.f7'>fig. 7</a>); whose complement is B C D E, and the
rectangle completed A B E D. Let this rectangle
be divided by the two strait lines L K and N O,
cutting one another in the centre M at right
angles; and because A B E D is to A B C D as 5 to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>3, let A B be divided in G, so that A G to B G be as
3 to 5; and let F G be drawn parallel to the base.
Also because A B E D is (by <a href='#art23.9'>art. 9</a>) to B C D E
as 5 to 2, let B E be divided in the point I, so that
B I be to I E as 5 to 2; and let I H be drawn
parallel to the axis, cutting L K and F G in P and Q.
Let now P R be so taken, that it be to P Q as 3 to
2, and let R M be drawn and produced to F G in S.
Seeing, therefore, R P is to P Q, that is, R M to
M S, as A B C D is to its complement B C D E,
and the centres of equiponderation of A B C D and
B C D E are in the strait lines F G and H I, and
the centre of equiponderation of them both together
in the point M; R will be the centre of the
complement B C D E, and S the centre of the
figure A B C D. And seeing P M, that is I N, is
to Q S, as R P is to R Q; and I N or P M is 3 of
those parts, of which B E, that is F G, is 14; therefore
Q S is 5 of the same parts; and E I, that is
F G, 4; and F S, 9; and G S, 5. Wherefore the
strait line S T being drawn parallel to the axis,
will divide the base A D into 5 and 9. But the
fraction <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>9</sub> is found in the fourth row of the table,
two places below the fraction ⅗ in the second row.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the same method, if in the same second row
there be taken the second three-sided figure of

half of it will be found to be in a strait line parallel
to the axis, dividing the base according to the
numbers of the fraction <sup>6</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>, two places below in
the fourth row. And the same way serves for all
the rest of the figures in the second row. In like
manner, the centre of equiponderation of the third
three-sided figure of three means will be found to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>be in a strait line parallel to the axis, dividing the
base, so that the part next the axis be to the other

<p class='c001'>Coroll. The centres of equiponderation of the
halves of the said figures are known, seeing they
are in the intersection of the strait lines S T and
F G, which are both known.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The centre of equiponderation of the half of any of the figures in the same table being known, the centre of the excess of the same figure above a triangle of the same altitude and base is also known.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art23.13'></a>13. The centre of equiponderation of the half of
any of the figures, which (in the table of <a href='#art17.3'>art. 3</a>,
chap. <span class='fss'>XVII</span>) are compared with their parallelograms,
being known; the centre of equiponderation
of the excess of the same figure above its triangle
is also known.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig23.8'></a>For example, let the semiparabola A B C D (in
<a href='#fig23.f8'>fig. 8</a>) be taken, whose axis is A B; whose complete
figure is A B E D; and whose excess above
its triangle is B C D B. Its centre of equiponderation
may be found out in this manner. Let F G
be drawn parallel to the base, so that A F be a
third part of the axis; and let H I be drawn parallel
to the axis, so that A H be a third part of
the base. This being done, the centre of equiponderation
of the triangle A B D will be I. Again,
let K L be drawn parallel to the base, so that
A K be to A B as 2 to 5; and M N parallel to the
axis, so that A M be to A D as 3 to 8; and let
M N terminate in the strait line K L. The centre,
therefore, of equiponderation of the parabola
A B C D is N; and therefore we have the centres
of equiponderation of the semiparabola A B C D,
and of its part the triangle A B D. That we may
now find the centre of equiponderation of the
remaining part B C D B, let I N be drawn and
produced to O, so that N O be triple to I N; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>O will be the centre sought for. For seeing the
weight of A B D to the weight of B C D B is in
proportion reciprocal to that of the strait line N O
to the strait line I N; and N is the centre of the
whole, and I the centre of the triangle A B D; O
will be the centre of the remaining part, namely,
of the figure B D C B; which was to be found.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. The centre of equiponderation of the
figure B D C B is in the concourse of two strait

divides the axis, so that the part next the base be

the axis, and so divides the base, that the part
towards the axis be ½, or <sup>12</sup>⁄<sub>24</sub> of the whole base.
For drawing O P parallel to the base, it will be as
I N to N O, so F K to K P, that is, so 1 to 3, or
5 to 15. But A F is <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>15</sub>, or ⅓ of the whole A B;
and A K is <sup>6</sup>⁄<sub>15</sub>, or ⅖; and F K <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>15</sub>; and KP <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>15</sub>;
and therefore A P is <sup>9</sup>⁄<sub>15</sub> of the axis A B. Also A H
is ⅓, or <sup>8</sup>⁄<sub>24</sub>; and A M ⅜, or <sup>9</sup>⁄<sub>24</sub> of the whole base;
and therefore O Q being drawn parallel to the
axis, M Q, which is triple to H M, will be <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>24</sub>.
Wherefore A Q is <sup>12</sup>⁄<sub>24</sub>, or ½ of the base A D.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The centre of equiponderation of a solid sector is in the axis so divided, that the part next the vertex be to the whole axis, wanting half the axis of the portion of the sphere, as 3 to 4.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art23.14'></a>14. The centre of equiponderation of the sector
of a sphere, that is, of a figure compounded of a
right cone, whose vertex is the centre of the
sphere, and the portion of the sphere whose base
is the same with that of the cone, divides the strait
line which is made of the axis of the cone and half
the axis of the portion together taken, so that the
part next the vertex be triple to the other part, or
to the whole strait line as 3 to 4.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig23.9'></a>For let A B C (in <a href='#fig23.f9'>fig. 9</a>) be the sector of a
sphere, whose vertex is the centre of the sphere A;
whose axis is A D; and the circle upon B C is the
common base of the portion of the sphere and of
the cone whose vertex is A; the axis of which
portion is E D, and the half thereof F D; and the
axis of the cone, A E. Lastly, let A G be <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> of the
strait line A F. I say, G is the centre of equiponderation
of the sector A B C.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the strait line F H be drawn of any length,
making right angles with A F at F; and drawing
the strait line A H, let the triangle A F H be made.
Then upon the same centre A let any arch I K be
drawn, cutting A D in L; and its chord, cutting
A D in M; and dividing M L equally in N, let N O
be drawn parallel to the strait line F H, and meeting
with the strait line A H in O.</p>

<p class='c001'>Seeing now B D C is the spherical superficies of
the portion cut off with a plane passing through
B C, and cutting the axis at right angles; and
seeing F H divides E D, the axis of the portion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>into two equal parts in F; the centre of equiponderation
of the superficies B D C will be in F (by
<a href='#art23.8'>art. 8</a>); and for the same reason the centre of
equiponderation of the superficies I L K, K being
in the strait line A C, will be in N. And in like
manner, if there were drawn, between the centre
of the sphere A and the outermost spherical superficies
of the sector, arches infinite in number, the
centres of equiponderation of the spherical superficies,
in which those arches are, would be found
to be in that part of the axis, which is intercepted
between the superficies itself and a plane passing
along by the chord of the arch, and cutting the
axis in the middle at right angles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let it now be supposed that the moment of the
outermost spherical superficies B D C is F H. Seeing
therefore the superficies B D C is to the superficies
I L K in proportion duplicate to that of the
arch B D C to the arch I L K, that is, of B E to
I M, that is, of F H to N O; let it be as F H to
N O, so N O to another N P; and again, as N O to
N P, so N P to another N Q; and let this be done

can possibly be drawn between the base and
the vertex of the triangle A F H. If then through
all the points Q there be drawn the crooked line
A Q H, the figure A F H Q A will be the complement
of the first three-sided figure of two means;
and the same will also be the moment of all the
spherical superficies, of which the solid sector
A B C D is compounded; and by consequent, the
moment of the sector itself. Let now F H be understood
to be the semidiameter of the base of a
right cone, whose side is A H, and axis A F
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>Wherefore, seeing the bases of the cones, which
pass through F and N and the rest of the points
of the axis, are in proportion duplicate to that of
the strait lines F H and N O, &#38;c., the moment of
all the bases together, that is, of the whole cone,
will be the figure itself A F H Q A; and therefore
the centre of equiponderation of the cone A F H is
the same with that of the solid sector. Wherefore,
seeing A G is ¾ of the axis A F, the centre of equiponderation
of the cone A F H is in G; and therefore
the centre of the solid sector is in G also, and
divides the part A F of the axis so that A G is
triple to G F; that is, A G is to A F as 3 to 4;
which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Note, that when the sector is a hemisphere, the
axis of the cone vanisheth into that point which
is the centre of the sphere; and therefore it
addeth nothing to half the axis of the portion.
Wherefore, if in the axis of the hemisphere there
be taken from the centre ¾ of half the axis, that is,
⅜ of the semidiameter of the sphere, there will be
the centre of equiponderation of the hemisphere.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span><span class='fss'>X.</span> And that medium in which there is equal resistance
everywhere, is a <em>homogeneous medium</em>.
All other mediums are <em>heterogeneous</em>.</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>In perpendicular motion there is no refraction.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art24.2'></a> If a body pass, or there be generation of motion
from one medium to another of different
density, in a line perpendicular to the separating
superficies, there will be no refraction.</p>

<p class='c001'>For seeing on every side of the perpendicular
all things in the mediums are supposed to be like
and equal, if the motion itself be supposed to be
perpendicular, the inclinations also will be equal,
or rather none at all; and therefore there can be
no cause from which refraction may be inferred to
be on one side of the perpendicular, which will
not conclude the same refraction to be on the
other side. Which being so, refraction on one
side will destroy refraction on the other side; and
consequently either the refracted line will be
everywhere, which is absurd, or there will be no
refracted line at all; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. It is manifest from hence, that the cause
of refraction consisteth only in the obliquity of the
line of incidence, whether the incident body penetrate
both the mediums, or without penetrating,
propagate motion by pressure only.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Things thrown out of a thinner into a thicker medium are so refracted that the angle refracted is greater than the angle of inclination.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art24.3'></a>3. If a body, without any change of situation of
its internal parts, as a stone, be moved obliquely
out of the thinner medium, and proceed penetrating
the thicker medium, and the thicker medium be
such, as that its internal parts being moved restore
themselves to their former situation; the angle
refracted will be greater than the angle of inclination.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>For let D B E (in the same first <a href='#fig24.f1'>figure</a>) be the
separating superficies of two mediums; and let a
body, as a stone thrown, be understood to be
moved as is supposed in the strait line A B C; and
let A B be in the thinner medium, as in the air;
and B C in the thicker, as in the water. I say the
stone, which being thrown, is moved in the line
A B, will not proceed in the line B C, but in some
other line, namely, that, with which the perpendicular
B H makes the refracted angle H B F greater
than the angle of inclination H B C.</p>

<p class='c001'>For seeing the stone coming from A, and falling
upon B, makes that which is at B proceed towards
H, and that the like is done in all the strait lines
which are parallel to B H; and seeing the parts
moved restore themselves by contrary motion in
the same line; there will be contrary motion generated
in H B, and in all the strait lines which are
parallel to it. Wherefore, the motion of the stone
will be made by the concourse of the motions in
A G, that is, in D B, and in G B, that is, in B H,
and lastly, in H B, that is, by the concourse of
three motions. But by the concourse of the motions
in A G and B H, the stone will be carried to
C; and therefore by adding the motion in H B, it
will be carried higher in some other line, as in
B F, and make the angle H B F greater than the
angle H B C.</p>

<p class='c001'>And from hence may be derived the cause, why
bodies which are thrown in a very oblique line, if
either they be any thing flat, or be thrown with
great force, will, when they fall upon the water, be
cast up again from the water into the air.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig24.2'></a>For let A B (in <a href='#fig24.f2'>fig. 2</a>) be the superficies of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>water; into which, from the point C, let a stone be
thrown in the strait line C A, making with the line
B A produced a very little angle C A D; and producing
B A indefinitely to D, let C D be drawn perpendicular
to it, and A E parallel to C D. The stone
therefore will be moved in C A by the concourse
of two motions in C D and D A, whose velocities
are as the lines themselves C D and D A. And from
the motion in C D and all its parallels downwards,
as soon as the stone falls upon A, there will be
reaction upwards, because the water restores itself
to its former situation. If now the stone be thrown
with sufficient obliquity, that is, if the strait line
C D be short enough, that is, if the endeavour of
the stone downwards be less than the reaction of
the water upwards, that is, less than the endeavour
it hath from its own gravity (for that may be), the
stone will by reason of the excess of the endeavour
which the water hath to restore itself, above that
which the stone hath downwards, be raised again
above the superficies A B, and be carried higher,
being reflected in a line which goes higher, as the
line A G.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Endeavour, which from one point tendeth every way, will be so refracted, as that the sine of the angle refracted will be to the sine of the angle of inclination, as the density of the first medium is to the density of the second medium, reciprocally taken.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art24.4'></a>4. If from a point, whatsoever the medium be, endeavour
be propagated every way into all the parts
of that medium; and to the same endeavour there
be obliquely opposed another medium of a different
nature, that is, either thinner or thicker; that
endeavour will be so refracted, that the sine of the
angle refracted, to the sine of the angle of inclination,
will be as the density of the first medium to
the density of the second medium, reciprocally
taken.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig24.3'></a>First, let a body be in the thinner medium in A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>(<a href='#fig23.f3'>fig. 3</a>), and let it be understood to have endeavour
every way, and consequently, that its endeavour
proceed in the lines A B and A <i>b</i>; to which let
B <i>b</i> the superficies of the thicker medium be
obliquely opposed in B and <i>b</i>, so that A B and A <i>b</i>
be equal; and let the strait line B <i>b</i> be produced
both ways. From the points B and <i>b</i>, let the perpendiculars
B C and <i>b c</i> be drawn; and upon the
centres B and <i>b</i>, and at the equal distances B A and
<i>b</i> A, let the circles A C and A <i>c</i> be described, cutting
B C and <i>b c</i> in C and <i>c</i>, and the same C B and <i>c b</i>
produced in D and <i>d</i>, as also A B and A <i>b</i> produced
in E and <i>e</i>. Then from the point A to the strait
lines B C and <i>b c</i> let the perpendiculars A F and A <i>f</i>
be drawn. A F therefore will be the sine of the
angle of inclination of the strait line A B, and A <i>f</i>
the sine of the angle of inclination of the strait
line A <i>h</i>, which two inclinations are by construction
made equal. I say, as the density of the
medium in which are B C and <i>b c</i> is to the density
of the medium in which are B D and <i>b d</i>, so is the
sine of the angle refracted, to the sine of the angle
of inclination.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the strait line F G be drawn parallel to the
strait line A B, meeting with the strait line <i>b</i> B
produced in G.</p>

<p class='c001'>Seeing therefore A F and B G are also parallels,
they will be equal; and consequently, the endeavour
in A F is propagated in the same time, in
which the endeavour in B G would be propagated
if the medium were of the same density. But
because B G is in a thicker medium, that is, in a
medium which resists the endeavour more than the
medium in which A F is, the endeavour will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>propagated less in B G than in A F, according to
the proportion which the density of the medium, in
which A F is, hath to the density of the medium in
which B G is. Let therefore the density of the
medium, in which B G is, be to the density of the
medium, in which A F is, as B G is to B H; and
let the measure of the time be the radius of the
circle. Let H I be drawn parallel to B D, meeting
with the circumference in I; and from the point
I let I K be drawn perpendicular to B D; which
being done, B H and I K will be equal; and I K
will be to A F, as the density of the medium in
which is A F is to the density of the medium in
which is I K. Seeing therefore in the time A B,
which is the radius of the circle, the endeavour is
propagated in A F in the thinner medium, it will
be propagated in the same time, that is, in the
time B I in the thicker medium from K to I.
Therefore, B I is the refracted line of the line of
incidence A B; and I K is the sine of the angle
refracted; and A F the sine of the angle of inclination.
Wherefore, seeing I K is to A F, as the
density of the medium in which is A F to the
density of the medium in which is I K; it will be
as the density of the medium in which is A F or
B C to the density of the medium in which is
I K or B D, so the sine of the angle refracted to
the sine of the angle of inclination. And by the
same reason it may be shown, that as the density
of the thinner medium is to the density of the
thicker medium, so will K I the sine of the angle
refracted be to A F the sine of the angle of inclination.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, let the body, which endeavoureth every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>way, be in the thicker medium at I. If, therefore,
both the mediums were of the same density, the
endeavour of the body in I B would tend directly
to L; and the sine of the angle of inclination L M
would be equal to I K or B H. But because the
density of the medium, in which is I K, to the
density of the medium, in which is L M, is as B H
to B G, that is, to A F, the endeavour will be propagated
further in the medium in which L M is,
than in the medium in which I K is, in the proportion
of density to density, that is, of M L to A F.
Wherefore, B A being drawn, the angle refracted
will be C B A, and its sine A F. But L M is the
sine of the angle of inclination; and therefore
again, as the density of one medium is to the
density of the different medium, so reciprocally
is the sine of the angle refracted to the sine of
the angle of inclination; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this demonstration, I have made the separating
superficies B <i>b</i> plane by construction. But
though it were concave or convex, the theorem
would nevertheless be true. For the refraction
being made in the point B of the plane separating
superficies, if a crooked line, as P Q, be drawn,
touching the separating line in the point B; neither
the refracted line B I, nor the perpendicular B D,
will be altered; and the refracted angle K B I, as
also its sine K I, will be still the same they were.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The sine of the refracted angle in one inclination is to the sine of the refracted angle in another inclination, as the sine of the angle of that inclination is to the sine of the angle of this inclination.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art24.5'></a>5. The sine of the angle refracted in one inclination
is to the sine of the angle refracted in
another inclination, as the sine of the angle of that
inclination to the sine of the angle of this inclination.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>For seeing the sine of the refracted angle is to
the sine of the angle of inclination, whatsoever
that inclination be, as the density of one medium
to the density of the other medium; the proportion
of the sine of the refracted angle, to the sine of
the angle of inclination, will be compounded of the
proportions of density to density, and of the sine
of the angle of one inclination to the sine of the
angle of the other inclination. But the proportions
of the densities in the same homogeneous
body are supposed to be the same. Wherefore
refracted angles in different inclinations are as the
sines of the angles of those inclinations; which
was to be demonstrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If two lines of incidence, having equal inclination, be one in a thinner the other in a thicker medium, the sine of the angle of inclination will be a mean proportional between the two sines of the refracted angles.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art24.6'></a>6. If two lines of incidence, having equal inclination,
be the one in a thinner, the other in a
thicker medium, the sine of the angle of their inclination
will be a mean proportional between the
two sines of their angles refracted.</p>

<p class='c001'>For let the strait line A B (in <a href='#fig24.f3'>fig. 3</a>) have its inclination
in the thinner medium, and be refracted
in the thicker medium in B I; and let E B have as
much inclination in the thicker medium, and be
refracted in the thinner medium in B S; and let
R S, the sine of the angle refracted, be drawn. I
say, the strait lines R S, A F, and I K are in continual
proportion. For it is, as the density of the
thicker medium to the density of the thinner medium,
so R S to A F. But it is also as the density
of the same thicker medium to that of the
same thinner medium, so A F to I K. Wherefore
R S. A F :: A F. I K are proportionals; that is, R S,
A F, and I K are in continual proportion, and A F
is the mean proportional; which was to be proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If the angle of inclination be semirect, and the line of inclination be in the thicker medium, and the proportion of their densities be the same with that of the diagonal to the side of a square, and the separating superficies be plain, the refracted line will be in the separating superficies.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span><a id='art24.7'></a>7. If the angle of inclination be semirect, and
the line of inclination be in the thicker medium,
and the proportion of the densities be as that of a
diagonal to the side of its square, and the separating
superficies be plain, the refracted line will
be in that separating superficies.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig24.4'></a>For in the circle A C (<a href='#fig24.f4'>fig. 4</a>) let the angle of inclination
A B C be an angle of 45 degrees. Let
C B be produced to the circumference in D; and
let C E, the sine of the angle E B C, be drawn, to
which let B F be taken equal in the separating
line B G. B C E F will therefore be a parallelogram,
and F E and B C, that is F E and B G equal.
Let A G be drawn, namely the diagonal of the
square whose side is B G, and it will be, as A G to
E F so B G to B F; and so, by supposition, the
density of the medium, in which C is, to the density
of the medium in which D is; and so also the
sine of the angle refracted to the sine of the angle
of inclination. Drawing therefore F D, and from
D the line D H perpendicular to A B produced,
D H will be the sine of the angle of inclination.
And seeing the sine of the angle refracted is to
the sine of the angle of inclination, as the density
of the medium, in which is C, is to the density of
the medium in which is D, that is, by supposition,
as A G is to F E, that is as B G is to D H; and
seeing D H is the sine of the angle of inclination,
B G will therefore be the sine of the angle refracted.
Wherefore B G will be the refracted line,
and lye in the plain separating superficies; which
was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. It is therefore manifest, that when the
inclination is greater than 45 degrees, as also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>when it is less, provided the density be greater, it
may happen that the refraction will not enter the
thinner medium at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If a body be carried in a strait line upon another body, and do not penetrate it, but be reflected from it, the angle of reflection will be equal to the angle of incidence.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art24.8'></a>8. If a body fall in a strait line upon another
body, and do not penetrate it, but be reflected
from it, the angle of reflection will be equal to
the angle of incidence.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig24.5'></a>Let there be a body at A (in <a href='#fig24.f5'>fig. 5</a>), which falling
with strait motion in the line A C upon another
body at C, passeth no further, but is reflected; and
let the angle of incidence be any angle, as A C D.
Let the strait line C E be drawn, making with D C
produced the angle E C F equal to the angle
A C D; and let A D be drawn perpendicular to
the strait line D F. Also in the same strait line
D F let C G be taken equal to C D; and let the
perpendicular G E be raised, cutting C E in E.
This being done, the triangles A C D and E C G
will be equal and like. Let C H be drawn equal
and parallel to the strait line A D; and let H C be
produced indefinitely to I. Lastly let E A be
drawn, which will pass through H, and be parallel
and equal to G D. I say the motion from A to C,
in the strait line of incidence A C, will be reflected
in the strait line C E.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the motion from A to C is made by two coefficient
or concurrent motions, the one in A H
parallel to D G, the other in A D perpendicular to
the same D G; of which two motions that in A H
works nothing upon the body A after it has been
moved as far as C, because, by supposition, it doth
not pass the strait line D G; whereas the endeavour
in A D, that is in H C, worketh further towards
I. But seeing it doth only press and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>penetrate, there will be reaction in H, which
causeth motion from C towards H; and in the
meantime the motion in H E remains the same it
was in A H; and therefore the body will now be
moved by the concourse of two motions in C H
and H E, which are equal to the two motions it
had formerly in A H and H C. Wherefore it will
be carried on in C E. The angle therefore of reflection
will be E C G, equal, by construction, to
the angle A C D; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now when the body is considered but as a point,
it is all one whether the superficies or line in
which the reflection is made be strait or crooked;
for the point of incidence and reflection C is as
well in the crooked line which toucheth D G in C,
as in D G itself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The same happens in the generation of motion in the line of incidence.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art24.9'></a>9. But if we suppose that not a body be moved,
but some endeavour only be propagated from A to
C, the demonstration will nevertheless be the
same. For all endeavour is motion; and when it
hath reached the solid body in C, it presseth it,
and endeavoureth further in C I. Wherefore the
reaction will proceed in C H; and the endeavour
in C H concurring with the endeavour in H E,
will generate the endeavour in C E, in the same
manner as in the repercussion of bodies moved.</p>

<p class='c001'>If therefore endeavour be propagated from any
point to the concave superficies of a spherical body,
the reflected line with the circumference of a great
circle in the same sphere will make an angle equal
to the angle of incidence.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig24.6'></a>For if endeavour be propagated from A (in <a href='#fig24.f6'>fig. 6</a>)
to the circumference in B, and the centre of
the sphere be C, and the line C B be drawn, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>also the tangent D B E; and lastly if the angle
F B D be made equal to the angle A B E, the reflection
will be made in the line B F, as hath been
newly shown. Wherefore the angles, which the
strait lines A B and F B make with the circumference,
will also be equal. But it is here to be
noted, that if C B be produced howsoever to G,
the endeavour in the line G B C will proceed only
from the perpendicular reaction in G B; and that
therefore there will be no other endeavour in the
point B towards the parts which are within the
sphere, besides that which tends towards the
centre.</p>

<p class='c001'>And here I put an end to the third part of this
discourse; in which I have considered motion and
magnitude by themselves in the abstract. The
fourth and last part, concerning the <em>phenomena of
nature</em>, that is to say, concerning the motions and
magnitudes of the bodies which are parts of the
world, real and existent, is that which follows.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The connexion of what hath been said with that which followeth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.1'></a>1. I have, in the first chapter, defined philosophy
to be <em>knowledge of effects acquired by true ratiocination,
from knowledge first had of their causes
and generation; and of such causes or generations
as may be, from former knowledge of their
effects or appearances</em>. There are, therefore,
two methods of philosophy; one, from the generation
of things to their possible effects; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>other, from their effects or appearances to some
possible generation of the same. In the former
of these the truth of the first principles of our
ratiocination, namely definitions, is made and constituted
by ourselves, whilst we consent and agree
about the appellations of things. And this part I
have finished in the foregoing chapters; in which,
if I am not deceived, I have affirmed nothing,
saving the definitions themselves, which hath not
good coherence with the definitions I have given;
that is to say, which is not sufficiently demonstrated
to all those, that agree with me in the use of words
and appellations; for whose sake only I have
written the same. I now enter upon the other
part; which is the finding out by the appearances
or effects of nature, which we know by sense, some
ways and means by which they may be, I do not
say they are, generated. The principles, therefore,
upon which the following discourse depends, are not
such as we ourselves make and pronounce in general
terms, as definitions; but such, as being placed
in the things themselves by the Author of Nature,
are by us observed in them; and we make use of
them in single and particular, not universal propositions.
Nor do they impose upon us any necessity
of constituting theorems; their use being only,
though not without such general propositions as
have been already demonstrated, to show us the
possibility of some production or generation. Seeing,
therefore, the science, which is here taught,
hath its principles in the appearances of nature,
and endeth in the attaining of some knowledge of
natural causes, I have given to this part the title
of <span class='sc'>Physics</span>, or the <i>Phenomena of Nature</i>. Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>such things as appear, or are shown to us by nature,
we call phenomena or appearances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all the phenomena or appearances which are
near us, the most admirable is apparition itself,
τὸ φαίνεσθαι; namely, that some natural bodies have
in themselves the patterns almost of all things, and
others of none at all. So that if the appearances
be the principles by which we know all other
things, we must needs acknowledge sense to be the
principle by which we know those principles, and
that all the knowledge we have is derived from it.
And as for the causes of sense, we cannot begin
our search of them from any other phenomenon
than that of sense itself. But you will say, by what
sense shall we take notice of sense? I answer, by
sense itself, namely, by the memory which for some
time remains in us of things sensible, though they
themselves pass away. For he that perceives that
he hath perceived, remembers.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, therefore, the causes of our
perception, that is, the causes of those ideas and
phantasms which are perpetually generated within us
whilst we make use of our senses, are to be enquired
into; and in what manner their generation proceeds.
To help which inquisition, we may observe
first of all, that our phantasms or ideas are not
always the same; but that new ones appear to us,
and old ones vanish, according as we apply our
organs of sense, now to one object, now to another.
Wherefore they are generated, and perish. And
from hence it is manifest, that they are some
change or mutation in the sentient.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The investigation of the nature of sense, and the definition of sense.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.2'></a>2. Now that all mutation or alteration is motion
or endeavour (and endeavour also is motion)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>in the internal parts of the thing that is altered,
hath been proved (in <a href='#art8.9'>art. 9</a>, chap. <span class='fss'>VIII</span>) from this,
that whilst even the least parts of any body remain
in the same situation in respect of one another, it
cannot be said that any alteration, unless perhaps
that the whole body together hath been moved, hath
happened to it; but that it both appeareth and is
the same it appeared and was before. Sense,
therefore, in the sentient, can be nothing else but
motion in some of the internal parts of the sentient;
and the parts so moved are parts of the organs of
sense. For the parts of our body, by which we
perceive any thing, are those we commonly call
the organs of sense. And so we find what is the
subject of our sense, namely, that in which are the
phantasms; and partly also we have discovered
the nature of sense, namely, that it is some internal
motion in the sentient.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have shown besides (in chap. <span class='fss'>IX</span>, <a href='#art9.7'>art. 7</a>) that
no motion is generated but by a body contiguous
and moved: from whence it is manifest, that the
immediate cause of sense or perception consists in
this, that the first organ of sense is touched and
pressed. For when the uttermost part of the organ
is pressed, it no sooner yields, but the part next
within it is pressed also; and, in this manner, the
pressure or motion is propagated through all the
parts of the organ to the innermost. And thus
also the pressure of the uttermost part proceeds
from the pressure of some more remote body, and
so continually, till we come to that from which,
as from its fountain, we derive the phantasm or idea
that is made in us by our sense. And this, whatsoever
it be, is that we commonly call <em>the object</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>Sense, therefore, is some internal motion in the
sentient, generated by some internal motion of the
parts of the object, and propagated through all the
media to the innermost part of the organ. By
which words I have almost defined what sense is.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, I have shown (<a href='#art15.2'>art. 2</a>, chap. <span class='fss'>XV</span>) that
all resistance is endeavour opposite to another endeavour,
that is to say, reaction. Seeing, therefore,
there is in the whole organ, by reason of its
own internal natural motion, some resistance or
reaction against the motion which is propagated
from the object to the innermost part of the organ,
there is also in the same organ an endeavour opposite
to the endeavour which proceeds from the
object; so that when that endeavour inwards is
the last action in the act of sense, then from the
reaction, how little soever the duration of it be, a
phantasm or idea hath its being; which, by reason
that the endeavour is now outwards, doth always
appear as something situate without the organ.
So that now I shall give you the whole definition
of sense, as it is drawn from the explication of the
causes thereof and the order of its generation, thus:
<span class='fss'>SENSE</span> <em>is a phantasm, made by the reaction and
endeavour outwards in the organ of sense, caused
by an endeavour inwards from the object, remaining
for some time more or less</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The subject and object of sense.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.3'></a>3. The <em>subject</em> of sense is the <em>sentient</em> itself,
namely, some living creature; and we speak more
correctly, when we say a living creature seeth,
than when we say the eye seeth. The object is the
thing received; and it is more accurately said,
that we see the sun, than that we see the light.
For light and colour, and heat and sound, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>other qualities which are commonly called sensible,
are not objects, but phantasms in the sentients.
For a phantasm is the act of sense, and differs no
otherwise from sense than <span lang="la"><i>fieri</i></span>, that is, being a
doing, differs from <span lang="la"><i>factum esse</i></span>, that is, being
done; which difference, in things that are done in
an instant, is none at all; and a phantasm is made in
an instant. For in all motion which proceeds by
perpetual propagation, the first part being moved
moves the second, the second the third, and so on
to the last, and that to any distance, how great
soever. And in what point of time the first or
foremost part proceeded to the place of the second,
which is thrust on, in the same point of time the
last save one proceeded into the place of the last
yielding part; which by reaction, in the same
instant, if the reaction be strong enough, makes a
phantasm; and a phantasm being made, perception
is made together with it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The organs of sense.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.4'></a>4. The <em>organs</em> of sense, which are in the sentient,
are such parts thereof, that if they be hurt,
the very generation of phantasms is thereby destroyed,
though all the rest of the parts remain
entire. Now these parts in the most of living
creatures are found to be certain spirits and membranes,
which, proceeding from the <span lang="la"><i>pia mater</i></span>,
involve the brain and all the nerves; also the
brain itself, and the arteries which are in the
brain; and such other parts, as being stirred, the
heart also, which is the fountain of all sense, is
stirred together with them. For whensoever the
action of the object reacheth the body of the
sentient, that action is by some nerve propagated
to the brain; and if the nerve leading thither be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>so hurt or obstructed, that the motion can be
propagated no further, no sense follows. Also if
the motion be intercepted between the brain and
the heart by the defect of the organ by which the
action is propagated, there will be no perception
of the object.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>All bodies are not endued with sense.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.5'></a>5. But though all sense, as I have said, be made
by reaction, nevertheless it is not necessary that
every thing that reacteth should have sense. I
know there have been philosophers, and those
learned men, who have maintained that all bodies
are endued with sense. Nor do I see how they
can be refuted, if the nature of sense be placed in
reaction only. And, though by the reaction of
bodies inanimate a phantasm might be made, it
would nevertheless cease, as soon as ever the
object were removed. For unless those bodies
had organs, as living creatures have, fit for the
retaining of such motion as is made in them, their
sense would be such, as that they should never
remember the same. And therefore this hath
nothing to do with that sense which is the subject
of my discourse. For by sense, we commonly
understand the judgment we make of objects by
their phantasms; namely, by comparing and distinguishing
those phantasms; which we could
never do, if that motion in the organ, by which
the phantasm is made, did not remain there for
some time, and make the same phantasm return.
Wherefore sense, as I here understand it, and
which is commonly so called, hath necessarily
some memory adhering to it, by which former and
later phantasms may be compared together, and
distinguished from one another.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>Sense, therefore, properly so called, must necessarily
have in it a perpetual variety of phantasms,
that they may be discerned one from
another. For if we should suppose a man to be
made with clear eyes, and all the rest of his organs
of sight well disposed, but endued with no other
sense; and that he should look only upon one
thing, which is always of the same colour and
figure, without the least appearance of variety,
he would seem to me, whatsoever others may say,
to see, no more than I seem to myself to feel the
bones of my own limbs by my organs of feeling;
and yet those bones are always and on all sides
touched by a most sensible membrane. I might
perhaps say he were astonished, and looked upon
it; but I should not say he saw it; it being almost
all one for a man to be always sensible of one and
the same thing, and not to be sensible at all of
any thing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>But one phantasm at one and the same time.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.6'></a>6. And yet such is the nature of sense, that it
does not permit a man to discern many things at
once. For seeing the nature of sense consists in
motion; as long as the organs are employed about
one object, they cannot be so moved by another at
the same time, as to make by both their motions
one sincere phantasm of each of them at once.
And therefore two several phantasms will not be
made by two objects working together, but only
one phantasm compounded from the action of both.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, as when we divide a body, we divide
its place; and when we reckon many bodies, we
must necessarily reckon as many places; and contrarily,
as I have shown in the <a href='#ch7'>seventh chapter</a>; so
what number soever we say there be of times, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>must understand the same number of motions
also; and as oft as we count many motions, so oft
we reckon many times. For though the object we
look upon be of divers colours, yet with those
divers colours it is but one varied object, and not
variety of objects.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, whilst those organs which are common
to all the senses, such as are those parts of
every organ which proceed in men from the root
of the nerves to the heart, are vehemently stirred
by a strong action from some one object, they are,
by reason of the contumacy which the motion,
they have already, gives them against the reception
of all other motion, made the less fit to receive
any other impression from whatsoever other objects,
to what sense soever those objects belong.
And hence it is, that an earnest studying of one
object, takes away the sense of all other objects for
the present. For <em>study</em> is nothing else but a possession
of the mind, that is to say, a vehement
motion made by some one object in the organs
of sense, which are stupid to all other motions as
long as this lasteth; according to what was said
by Terence, “<span lang="la"><i>Populus studio stupidus in funambulo
animum occuparat.</i></span>” For what is <em>stupor</em> but
that which the Greeks call ἀναισθησία, that is, a
cessation from the sense of other things? Wherefore
at one and the same time, we cannot by sense
perceive more than one single object; as in reading,
we see the letters successively one by one,
and not all together, though the whole page be
presented to our eye; and though every several
letter be distinctly written there, yet when we look
upon the whole page at once, we read nothing.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>From hence it is manifest, that every endeavour
of the organ outwards, is not to be called sense,
but that only, which at several times is by vehemence
made stronger and more predominant than
the rest; which deprives us of the sense of other
phantasms, no otherwise than the sun deprives
the rest of the stars of light, not by hindering their
action, but by obscuring and hiding them with his
excess of brightness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Imagination, the remains of past sense; which also is memory. Of sleep.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.7'></a>7. But the motion of the organ, by which a
phantasm is made, is not commonly called sense,
except the object be present. And the phantasm
remaining after the object is removed or past by,
is called <em>fancy</em>, and in Latin <span lang="la"><i>imaginatio</i></span>; which
word, because all phantasms are not images, doth
not fully answer the signification of the word <em>fancy</em>
in its general acceptation. Nevertheless I may
use it safely enough, by understanding it for the
Greek Φαντασία.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Imagination</span> therefore is nothing else but <em>sense
decaying</em>, or <em>weakened</em>, by the absence of the
object. But what may be the cause of this decay
or weakening? Is the motion the weaker, because
the object is taken away? If it were, then phantasms
would always and necessarily be less clear
in the imagination, than they are in sense; which
is not true. For in dreams, which are the imaginations
of those that sleep, they are no less clear
than in sense itself. But the reason why in men
waking the phantasms of things past are more
obscure than those of things present, is this, that
their organs being at the same time moved by
other present objects, those phantasms are the less
predominant. Whereas in sleep, the passages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>being shut up, external action doth not at all
disturb or hinder internal motion.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this be true, the next thing to be considered,
will be, whether any cause may be found out, from
the supposition whereof it will follow, that the passage
is shut up from the external objects of sense
to the internal organ. I suppose, therefore, that
by the continual action of objects, to which a reaction
of the organ, and more especially of the
spirits, is necessarily consequent, the organ is
wearied, that is, its parts are no longer moved by
the spirits without some pain; and consequently
the nerves being abandoned and grown slack, they
retire to their fountain, which is the cavity either
of the brain or of the heart; by which means the
action which proceeded by the nerves is necessarily
intercepted. For action upon a patient, that retires
from it, makes but little impression at the
first; and at last, when the nerves are by little
and little slackened, none at all. And therefore
there is no more reaction, that is, no more sense,
till the organ being refreshed by rest, and by a
supply of new spirits recovering strength and
motion, the sentient awaketh. And thus it seems
to be always, unless some other preternatural
cause intervene; as heat in the internal parts
from lassitude, or from some disease stirring the
spirits and other parts of the organ in some extraordinary
manner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How phantasms succeed one another.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.8'></a>8. Now it is not without cause, nor so casual a
thing as many perhaps think it, that phantasms in
this their great variety proceed from one another;
and that the same phantasms sometimes bring into
the mind other phantasms like themselves, and at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>other times extremely unlike. For in the motion
of any continued body, one part follows another by
cohesion; and therefore, whilst we turn our eyes
and other organs successively to many objects, the
motion which was made by every one of them remaining,
the phantasms are renewed as often as
any one of those motions comes to be predominant
above the rest; and they become predominant in
the same order in which at any time formerly they
were generated by sense. So that when by length
of time very many phantasms have been generated
within us by sense, then almost any thought may
arise from any other thought; insomuch that it
may seem to be a thing indifferent and casual,
which thought shall follow which. But for the
most part this is not so uncertain a thing to waking
as to sleeping men. For the thought or phantasm
of the desired end brings in all the phantasms,
that are means conducing to that end, and that in
order backwards from the last to the first, and
again forwards from the beginning to the end.
But this supposes both appetite, and judgment to
discern what means conduce to the end, which is
gotten by experience; and experience is store of
phantasms, arising from the sense of very many
things. For φανταζεσθαι and <span lang="la"><i>meminisse</i></span>, <em>fancy</em> and
<em>memory</em>, differ only in this, that memory supposeth
the time past, which fancy doth not. In memory,
the phantasms we consider are as if they were worn
out with time; but in our fancy we consider them
as they are; which distinction is not of the things
themselves, but of the considerations of the sentient.
For there is in memory something like that
which happens in looking upon things at a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>distance; in which as the small parts of the object
are not discerned, by reason of their remoteness; so
in memory, many accidents and places and parts
of things, which were formerly perceived by sense,
are by length of time decayed and lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>The perpetual arising of phantasms, both in
sense and imagination, is that which we commonly
call discourse of the mind, and is common to men
with other living creatures. For he that thinketh,
compareth the phantasms that pass, that is, taketh
notice of their likeness or unlikeness to one another.
And as he that observes readily the likenesses
of things of different natures, or that are
very remote from one another, is said to have a
good fancy; so he is said to have a good judgment,
that finds out the unlikenesses or differences of
things that are like one another. Now this observation
of differences is not perception made by a
common organ of sense, distinct from sense or
perception properly so called, but is memory of the
differences of particular phantasms remaining for
some time; as the distinction between hot and
lucid, is nothing else but the memory both of a
heating, and of an enlightening object.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dreams, whence they proceed.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.9'></a>9. The phantasms of men that sleep, are <em>dreams</em>.
Concerning which we are taught by experience
these five things. First, that for the most part
there is neither order nor coherence in them.
Secondly, that we dream of nothing but what is
compounded and made up of the phantasms of
sense past. Thirdly, that sometimes they proceed,
as in those that are drowsy, from the interruption
of their phantasms by little and little, broken and
altered through sleepiness; and sometimes also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>they begin in the midst of sleep. Fourthly, that
they are clearer than the imaginations of waking
men, except such as are made by sense itself, to
which they are equal in clearness. Fifthly, that
when we dream, we admire neither the places nor
the looks of the things that appear to us. Now
from what hath been said, it is not hard to show
what may be the causes of these phenomena. For
as for the first, seeing all order and coherence
proceeds from frequent looking back to the end,
that is, from consultation; it must needs be, that
seeing in sleep we lose all thought of the end, our
phantasms succeed one another, not in that order
which tends to any end, but as it happeneth, and in
such manner, as objects present themselves to our
eyes when we look indifferently upon all things
before us, and see them, not because we would see
them, but because we do not shut our eyes; for
then they appear to us without any order at all.
The second proceeds from this, that in the silence
of sense there is no new motion from the objects,
and therefore no new phantasm, unless we call that
new, which is compounded of old ones, as a chimera,
a golden mountain, and the like. As for the
third, why a dream is sometimes as it were the
continuation of sense, made up of broken phantasms,
as in men distempered with sickness, the
reason is manifestly this, that in some of the organs
sense remains, and in others it faileth. But how
some phantasms may be revived, when all the
exterior organs are benumbed with sleep, is not
so easily shown. Nevertheless that, which hath
already been said, contains the reason of this also.
For whatsoever strikes the <span lang="la"><i>pia mater</i></span>, reviveth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>some of those phantasms that are still in motion
in the brain; and when any internal motion of the
heart reacheth that membrane, then the predominant
motion in the brain makes the phantasm.
Now the motions of the heart are appetites and
aversions, of which I shall presently speak further.
And as appetites and aversions are generated by
phantasms, so reciprocally phantasms are generated
by appetites and aversions. For example,
heat in the heart proceeds from anger and fighting;
and again, from heat in the heart, whatsoever
be the cause of it, is generated anger and the
image of an enemy, in sleep. And as love and
beauty stir up heat in certain organs; so heat in
the same organs, from whatsoever it proceeds,
often causeth desire and the image of an unresisting
beauty. Lastly, cold doth in the same manner
generate fear in those that sleep, and causeth them
to dream of ghosts, and to have phantasms of
horror and danger; as fear also causeth cold in
those that wake. So reciprocal are the motions
of the heart and brain. The fourth, namely, that
the things we seem to see and feel in sleep, are as
clear as in sense itself, proceeds from two causes;
one, that having then no sense of things without
us, that internal motion which makes the phantasm,
in the absence of all other impressions, is
predominant; and the other, that the parts of our
phantasms which are decayed and worn out by
time, are made up with other fictitious parts. To
conclude, when we dream, we do not wonder at
strange places and the appearances of things unknown
to us, because admiration requires that the
things appearing be new and unusual, which can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>happen to none but those that remember former
appearances; whereas in sleep, all things appear
as present.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is here to be observed, that certain dreams,
especially such as some men have when they are
between sleeping and waking, and such as happen
to those that have no knowledge of the nature of
dreams and are withal superstitious, were not
heretofore nor are now accounted dreams. For
the apparitions men thought they saw, and the
voices they thought they heard in sleep, were not
believed to be phantasms, but things subsisting of
themselves, and objects without those that dreamed.
For to some men, as well sleeping as waking, but
especially to guilty men, and in the night, and in
hallowed places, fear alone, helped a little with the
stories of such apparitions, hath raised in their
minds terrible phantasms, which have been and
are still deceitfully received for things really true,
under the names of <em>ghosts</em> and <em>incorporeal substances</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the senses, their kinds, their organs and phantasms, proper and common.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.10'></a>10. In most living creatures there are observed
five kinds of senses, which are distinguished by their
organs, and by their different kinds of phantasms;
namely, <em>sight</em>, <em>hearing</em>, <em>smell</em>, <em>taste</em>, and <em>touch</em>;
and these have their organs partly peculiar to each
of them severally, and partly common to them all.
The organ of sight is partly animate, and partly
inanimate. The inanimate parts are the three
humours; namely, the watery humour, which by
the interposition of the membrane called uvea, the
perforation whereof is called the apple of the eye,
is contained on one side by the first concave superficies
of the eye, and on the other side by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>ciliary processes, and the coat of the crystalline
humour; the crystalline, which, hanging in the
midst between the ciliary processes, and being
almost of spherical figure, and of a thick consistence,
is enclosed on all sides with its own transparent
coat; and the vitreous or glassy humour,
which filleth all the rest of the cavity of the eye,
and is somewhat thicker then the watery humour,
but thinner than the crystalline. The animate part
of the organ is, first, the membrane <span lang="la"><i>choroeides</i></span>,
which is a part of the <span lang="la"><i>pia mater</i></span>, saving that it is
covered with a coat derived from the marrow of
the optic nerve, which is called the <em>retina</em>; and
this <span lang="la"><i>choroeides</i></span>, seeing it is part of the <span lang="la"><i>pia mater</i></span>, is
continued to the beginning of the <span lang="la"><i>medulla spinalis</i></span>
within the scull, in which all the nerves which are
within the head have their roots. Wherefore all
the animal spirits that the nerves receive, enter
into them there; for it is not imaginable that they
can enter into them anywhere else. Seeing therefore
sense is nothing else but the action of objects
propagated to the furthest part of the organ; and
seeing also that animal spirits are nothing but vital
spirits purified by the heart, and carried from it by
the arteries; it follows necessarily, that the action
is derived from the heart by some of the arteries
to the roots of the nerves which are in the head,
whether those arteries be the <span lang="la"><i>plexus retiformis</i></span>, or
whether they be other arteries which are inserted
into the substance of the brain. And, therefore,
those arteries are the complement or the remaining
part of the whole organ of sight. And this
last part is a common organ to all the senses;
whereas, that which reacheth from the eye to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>roots of the nerves is proper only to sight. The
proper organ of hearing is the tympanum of the
ear and its own nerve; from which to the heart
the organ is common. So the proper organs of
smell and taste are nervous membranes, in the
palate and tongue for the taste, and in the nostrils
for the smell; and from the roots of those nerves
to the heart all is common. Lastly, the proper
organ of touch are nerves and membranes dispersed
through the whole body; which membranes are
derived from the root of the nerves. And all
things else belonging alike to all the senses seem
to be administered by the arteries, and not by the
nerves.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proper phantasm of sight is light; and
under this name of light, colour also, which is
nothing but perturbed light, is comprehended.
Wherefore the phantasm of a lucid body is light;
and of a coloured body, colour. But the object of
sight, properly so called, is neither light nor colour,
but the body itself which is lucid, or enlightened,
or coloured. For light and colour, being phantasms
of the sentient, cannot be accidents of the
object. Which is manifest enough from this, that
visible things appear oftentimes in places in which
we know assuredly they are not, and that in different
places they are of different colours, and
may at one and the same time appear in divers
places. Motion, rest, magnitude, and figure, are
common both to the sight and touch; and the
whole appearance together of figure, and light or
colour, is by the Greeks commonly called εἴδος, and
εἴδωλον, and ἱδέα; and by the Latins, <span lang="la"><i>species</i></span> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span><span lang="la"><i>imago</i></span>; all which names signify no more but appearance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The phantasm, which is made by hearing, is
sound; by smell, odour; by taste, savour; and by
touch, hardness and softness, heat and cold, wetness,
oiliness, and many more, which are easier to
be distinguished by sense than words. Smoothness,
roughness, rarity, and density, refer to figure,
and are therefore common both to touch and sight.
And as for the objects of hearing, smell, taste, and
touch, they are not sound, odour, savour, hardness,
&#38;c., but the bodies themselves from which
sound, odour, savour, hardness, &#38;c. proceed; of
the causes of which, and of the manner how they
are produced, I shall speak hereafter.</p>

<p class='c001'>But these phantasms, though they be effects in
the sentient, as subject, produced by objects working
upon the organs; yet there are also other
effects besides these, produced by the same objects
in the same organs; namely certain motions proceeding
from sense, which are called <em>animal
motions</em>. For seeing in all sense of external things
there is mutual action and reaction, that is, two
endeavours opposing one another, it is manifest
that the motion of both of them together will be
continued every way, especially to the confines of
both the bodies. And when this happens in the
internal organ, the endeavour outwards will proceed
in a solid angle, which will be greater, and
consequently the idea greater, than it would have
been if the impression had been weaker.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The magnitude of images, how and by what it is determined.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.11'></a>11. From hence the natural cause is manifest,
first, why those things seem to be greater, which,
<span lang="la"><i>cæteris paribus</i></span>, are seen in a greater angle:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>secondly, why in a serene cold night, when the
moon doth not shine, more of the fixed stars appear
than at another time. For their action is less
hindered by the serenity of the air, and not obscured
by the greater light of the moon, which is
then absent; and the cold, making the air more
pressing, helpeth or strengtheneth the action of the
stars upon our eyes; in so much as stars may then
be seen which are seen at no other time. And this
may suffice to be said in general concerning sense
made by the reaction of the organ. For, as for
the place of the image, the deceptions of sight, and
other things of which we have experience in ourselves
by sense, seeing they depend for the most
part upon the fabric itself of the eye of man, I shall
speak of them then when I come to speak of man.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pleasure, pain, appetite, and aversion, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.12'></a>12. But there is another kind of sense, of which
I will say something in this place, namely, the
sense of pleasure and pain, proceeding not from
the reaction of the heart outwards, but from continual
action from the outermost part of the organ
towards the heart. For the original of life being
in the heart, that motion in the sentient, which is
propagated to the heart, must necessarily make
some alteration or diversion of vital motion, namely,
by quickening or slackening, helping or hindering
the same. Now when it helpeth, it is pleasure;
and when it hindereth, it is pain, trouble, grief,
&#38;c. And as phantasms seem to be without, by
reason of the endeavour outwards, so pleasure and
pain, by reason of the endeavour of the organ inwards,
seem to be within; namely, there where the
first cause of the pleasure or pain is; as when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>pain proceeds from a wound, we think the pain
and the wound are both in the same place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pleasure, pain, appetite, and aversion, what they are.</div>

<p class='c001'>Now vital motion is the motion of the blood,
perpetually circulating (as hath been shown from
many infallible signs and marks by Doctor Harvey,
the first observer of it) in the veins and arteries.
Which motion, when it is hindered by some other
motion made by the action of sensible objects, may
be restored again either by bending or setting
strait the parts of the body; which is done when
the spirits are carried now into these, now into
other nerves, till the pain, as far as is possible, be
quite taken away. But if vital motion be helped
by motion made by sense, then the parts of the
organ will be disposed to guide the spirits in such
manner as conduceth most to the preservation and
augmentation of that motion, by the help of the
nerves. And in animal motion this is the very
first endeavour, and found even in the embryo;
which while it is in the womb, moveth its limbs
with voluntary motion, for the avoiding of whatsoever
troubleth it, or for the pursuing of what
pleaseth it. And this first endeavour, when it
tends towards such things as are known by experience
to be pleasant, is called <em>appetite</em>, that is, an
approaching; and when it shuns what is troublesome,
<em>aversion</em>, or flying from it. And little infants,
at the beginning and as soon as they are
born, have appetite to very few things, as also they
avoid very few, by reason of their want of experience
and memory; and therefore they have not so
great a variety of animal motion as we see in those
that are more grown. For it is not possible, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>such knowledge as is derived from sense, that
is, without experience and memory, to know what
will prove pleasant or hurtful; only there is some
place for conjecture from the looks or aspects of
things. And hence it is, that though they do not
know what may do them good or harm, yet sometimes
they approach and sometimes retire from
the same thing, as their doubt prompts them. But
afterwards, by accustoming themselves by little
and little, they come to know readily what is to be
pursued and what to be avoided; and also to have
a ready use of their nerves and other organs, in
the pursuing and avoiding of good and bad.
Wherefore appetite and aversion are the first endeavours
of animal motion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Consequent to this first endeavour, is the impulsion
into the nerves and retraction again of animal
spirits, of which it is necessary there be some receptacle
or place near the original of the nerves; and
this motion or endeavour is followed by a swelling
and relaxation of the muscles; and lastly, these
are followed by contraction and extension of the
limbs, which is animal motion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Deliberation and will, what.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art25.13'></a>13. The considerations of appetites and aversions
are divers. For seeing living creatures have
sometimes appetite and sometimes aversion to the
same thing, as they think it will either be for their
good or their hurt; while that vicissitude of appetites
and aversions remains in them, they have that
series of thoughts which is called <em>deliberation</em>;
which lasteth as long as they have it in their power
to obtain that which pleaseth, or to avoid that
which displeaseth them. Appetite, therefore, and
aversion are simply so called as long as they follow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>not deliberation. But if deliberation have gone
before, then the last act of it, if it be appetite, is
called <em>will</em>; if aversion, <em>unwillingness</em>. So that
the same thing is called both will and appetite;
but the consideration of them, namely, before and
after deliberation, is divers. Nor is that which is
done within a man whilst he willeth any thing,
different from that which is done in other living
creatures, whilst, deliberation having preceded,
they have appetite.</p>

<p class='c001'>Neither is the freedom of willing or not willing,
greater in man, than in other living creatures. For
where there is appetite, the entire cause of appetite
hath preceded; and, consequently, the act of
appetite could not choose but follow, that is, hath
of necessity followed (as is shown in chapter <span class='fss'>IX</span>,
<a href='#art9.5'>article 5</a>). And therefore such a liberty as is free
from necessity, is not to be found in the will either
of men or beasts. But if by liberty we understand
the faculty or power, not of willing, but of doing
what they will, then certainly that liberty is to be
allowed to both, and both may equally have it,
whensoever it is to be had.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, when appetite and aversion do with celerity
succeed one another, the whole series made by
them hath its name sometimes from one, sometimes
from the other. For the same deliberation,
whilst it inclines sometimes to one, sometimes to
the other, is from appetite called <em>hope</em>, and from
aversion, <em>fear</em>. For where there is no hope, it is
not to be called fear, but <em>hate</em>; and where no fear,
not hope, but <em>desire</em>. To conclude, all the passions,
called passions of the mind, consist of appetite and
aversion, except pure pleasure and pain, which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>a certain fruition of good or evil; as anger is aversion
from some imminent evil, but such as is joined
with appetite of avoiding that evil by force. But
because the passions and perturbations of the mind
are innumerable, and many of them not to be
discerned in any creatures besides men; I will
speak of them more at large in that section which
is concerning <em>man</em>. As for those objects, if there
be any such, which do not at all stir the mind, we
are said to contemn them.</p>

<p class='c001'>And thus much of sense in general. In the next
place I shall speak of sensible objects.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The magnitude and duration of the world, inscrutable.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art26.1'></a>1. Consequent to the contemplation of sense is
the contemplation of bodies, which are the efficient
causes or objects of sense. Now every object is
either a part of the whole world, or an aggregate
of parts. The greatest of all bodies, or sensible
objects, is the world itself; which we behold when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>we look round about us from this point of the same
which we call the earth. Concerning the world,
as it is one aggregate of many parts, the things
that fall under inquiry are but few; and those we
can determine, none. Of the whole world we may
inquire what is its magnitude, what its duration,
and how many there be, but nothing else. For as
for place and time, that is to say, magnitude and
duration, they are only our own fancy of a body
simply so called, that is to say, of a body indefinitely
taken, as I have shown before in <a href='#ch7'>chapter <span class='fss'>VII</span></a>.
All other phantasms are of bodies or objects, as
they are distinguished from one another; as colour,
the phantasm of coloured bodies; sound, of bodies
that move the sense of hearing, &#38;c. The questions
concerning the magnitude of the world are whether
it be finite or infinite, full or not full; concerning
its duration, whether it had a beginning, or be
eternal; and concerning the number, whether there
be one or many; though as concerning the number,
if it were of infinite magnitude, there could
be no controversy at all. Also if it had a beginning,
then by what cause and of what matter it was
made; and again, from whence that cause and
that matter had their being, will be new questions;
till at last we come to one or many eternal cause
or causes. And the determination of all these
things belongeth to him that professeth the universal
doctrine of philosophy, in case as much
could be known as can be sought. But the knowledge
of what is infinite can never be attained by a
finite inquirer. Whatsoever we know that are men,
we learn it from our phantasms; and of infinite,
whether magnitude or time, there is no phantasm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>at all; so that it is impossible either for a man or
any other creature to have any conception of infinite.
And though a man may from some effect
proceed to the immediate cause thereof, and from
that to a more remote cause, and so ascend continually
by right ratiocination from cause to cause;
yet he will not be able to proceed eternally, but
wearied will at last give over, without knowing
whether it were possible for him to proceed to an
end or not. But whether we suppose the world to
be finite or infinite, no absurdity will follow. For
the same things which now appear, might appear,
whether the Creator had pleased it should be finite
or infinite. Besides, though from this, that nothing
can move itself, it may rightly be inferred that
there was some first eternal movent; yet it can
never be inferred, though some used to make such
inference, that that movent was eternally immoveable,
but rather eternally moved. For as it is true,
that nothing is moved by itself; so it is true also
that nothing is moved but by that which is already
moved. The questions therefore about the magnitude
and beginning of the world, are not to be
determined by philosophers, but by those that are
lawfully authorized to order the worship of God.
For as Almighty God, when he had brought his
people into Judæa, allowed the priests the first
fruits reserved to himself; so when he had delivered
up the world to the disputations of men, it was his
pleasure that all opinions concerning the nature of
infinite and eternal, known only to himself, should,
as the first fruits of wisdom, be judged by those
whose ministry he meant to use in the ordering of
religion. I cannot therefore commend those that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>boast they have demonstrated, by reasons drawn
from natural things, that the world had a beginning.
They are contemned by idiots, because they understand
them not; and by the learned, because they
understand them; by both deservedly. For who
can commend him that demonstrates thus? "If the
world be eternal, then an infinite number of days,
or other measures of time, preceded the birth of
Abraham. But the birth of Abraham preceded
the birth of Isaac; and therefore one infinite is
greater than another infinite, or one eternal than
another eternal; which," he says, "is absurd." This
demonstration is like his, who from this, that the
number of even numbers is infinite, would conclude
that there are as many even numbers as there
are numbers simply, that is to say, the even numbers
are as many as all the even and odd together.
They, which in this manner take away eternity
from the world, do they not by the same means
take away eternity from the Creator of the world?
From this absurdity therefore they run into another,
being forced to call eternity <span lang="la"><i>nunc stans</i></span>, a standing
still of the present time, or an abiding now; and,
which is much more absurd, to give to the infinite
number of numbers the name of unity. But why
should eternity be called an abiding now, rather
than an abiding then? Wherefore there must
either be many eternities, or <i>now</i> and <i>then</i> must
signify the same. With such demonstrators as
these, that speak in another language, it is impossible
to enter into disputation. And the men,
that reason thus absurdly, are not idiots, but,
which makes the absurdity unpardonable, geometricians,
and such as take upon them to be judges,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>impertinent, but severe judges of other men's
demonstrations. The reason is this, that as soon
as they are entangled in the words <i>infinite</i> and
<i>eternal</i>, of which we have in our mind no idea, but
that of our own insufficiency to comprehend them,
they are forced either to speak something absurd,
or, which they love worse, to hold their peace. For
geometry hath in it somewhat like wine, which,
when new, is windy; but afterwards though less
pleasant, yet more wholesome. Whatsoever therefore
is true, young geometricians think demonstrable;
but elder not. Wherefore I purposely pass
over the questions of infinite and eternal; contenting
myself with that doctrine concerning the
beginning and magnitude of the world, which I
have been persuaded to by the holy Scriptures and
fame of the miracles which confirm them; and by
the custom of my country, and reverence due to
the laws. And so I pass on to such things as it is
not unlawful to dispute of.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>No place in the world empty.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art26.2'></a>2. Concerning the world it is further questioned,
whether the parts thereof be contiguous to one
another, in such manner as not to admit of the least
empty space between; and the disputation both for
and against it is carried on with probability enough.
For the taking away of vacuum, I will instance in
only one experiment, a common one, but I think
unanswerable.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig26.1'></a>Let A B (in <a href='#fig26.f1'>fig. 1</a>) represent a vessel, such as
gardeners use to water their gardens withal; whose
bottom B is full of little holes; and whose mouth
A may be stopped with one's finger, when there
shall be need. If now this vessel be filled with
water, the hole at the top A being stopped, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>water will not flow out at any of the holes in the
bottom B. But if the finger be removed to let in
the air above, it will run out at them all; and as;
soon as the finger is applied to it again, the water
will suddenly and totally be stayed again from
running out. The cause whereof seems to be no
other but this, that the water cannot by its natural
endeavour to descend drive down the air below it,
because there is no place for it to go into, unless
either by thrusting away the next contiguous air,
it proceed by continual endeavour to the hole A,
where it may enter and succeed into the place of
the water that floweth out, or else, by resisting the
endeavour of the water downwards, penetrate the
same and pass up through it. By the first of these
ways, while the hole at A remains stopped, there
is no possible passage; nor by the second, unless
the holes be so great that the water, flowing out
at them, can by its own weight force the air at the
same time to ascend into the vessel by the same
holes: as we see it does in a vessel whose mouth
is wide enough, when we turn suddenly the bottom
upwards to pour out the water; for then the air
being forced by the weight of the water, enters, as
is evident by the sobbing and resistance of the
water, at the sides or circumference of the orifice.
And this I take for a sign that all space is full;
for without this, the natural motion of the water,
which is a heavy body, downwards, would not be
hindered.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The arguments of Lucretius for vacuum invalid.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art26.3'></a>3. On the contrary, for the establishing of vacuum,
many and specious arguments and experiments
have been brought. Nevertheless there
seems to be something wanting in all of them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>conclude it firmly. These arguments for vacuum
are partly made by the followers of the doctrine
of Epicurus; who taught that the world consists
of very small spaces not filled by any body, and of
very small bodies that have within them no empty
space, which by reason of their hardness he calls
<i>atoms</i>; and that these small bodies and spaces are
every where intermingled. Their arguments are
thus delivered by Lucretius.</p>

<p class='c001'>And first he says, that unless it were so, there
could be no motion. For the office and property
of bodies is to withstand and hinder motion. If,
therefore, the universe were filled with body,
motion would everywhere be hindered, so as to
have no beginning anywhere; and consequently
there would be no motion at all. It is true that in
whatsoever is full and at rest in all its parts, it is
not possible motion should have beginning. But
nothing is drawn from hence for the proving of
vacuum. For though it should be granted that
there is vacuum, yet if the bodies which are intermingled
with it, should all at once and together
be at rest, they would never be moved again.
For it has been demonstrated above, in chap. <span class='fss'>IX</span>,
<a href='#art9.7'>art. 7</a>, that nothing can be moved but by that
which is contiguous and already moved. But
supposing that all things are at rest together, there
can be nothing contiguous and moved, and therefore
no beginning of motion. Now the denying
of the beginning of motion, doth not take away
present motion, unless beginning be taken away
from body also. For motion may be either co-eternal,
or concreated with body. Nor doth it
seem more necessary that bodies were first at rest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>and afterwards moved, than that they were first
moved, and rested, if ever they rested at all, afterwards.
Neither doth there appear any cause, why
the matter of the world should, for the admission
of motion, be intermingled with empty spaces
rather than full; I say full, but withal fluid. Nor,
lastly, is there any reason why those hard atoms
may not also, by the motion of intermingled fluid
matter, be congregated and brought together into
compounded bodies of such bigness as we see.
Wherefore nothing can by this argument be concluded,
but that motion was either coeternal, or of
the same duration with that which is moved;
neither of which conclusions consisteth with the
doctrine of Epicurus, who allows neither to the
world nor to motion any beginning at all. The
necessity, therefore, of vacuum is not hitherto demonstrated.
And the cause, as far as I understand
from them that have discoursed with me of vacuum,
is this, that whilst they contemplate the nature of
fluid, they conceive it to consist, as it were, of
small grains of hard matter, in such manner as
meal is fluid, made so by grinding of the corn;
when nevertheless it is possible to conceive fluid
to be of its own nature as homogeneous as either
an atom, or as vacuum itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second of their arguments is taken from
weight, and is contained in these verses of Lucretius:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Corporis officium est quoniam premere omnia deorsum;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Contra autem natura manet sine pondere inanis;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Ergo, quod magnum est æque, leviusque videtur,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Nimirum plus esse sibi declarat inanis.--I. 363-66.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>That is to say, <i>seeing the office and property of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>body is to press all things downwards; and on
the contrary, seeing the nature of vacuum is to
have no weight at all; therefore when of two
bodies of equal magnitude, one is lighter than the
other, it is manifest that the lighter body hath in
it more vacuum than the other</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>To say nothing of the assumption concerning
the endeavour of bodies downwards, which is not
rightly assumed, because the world hath nothing
to do with downwards, which is a mere fiction of
ours; nor of this, that if all things tended to the
same lowest part of the world, either there would
be no coalescence at all of bodies, or they would
all be gathered together into the same place: this
only is sufficient to take away the force of the
argument, that air, intermingled with those his
atoms, had served as well for his purpose as his
intermingled vacuum.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third argument is drawn from this, that
lightning, sound, heat and cold, do penetrate all
bodies, except atoms, how solid soever they be.
But this reason, except it be first demonstrated
that the same things cannot happen without vacuum
by perpetual generation of motion, is altogether
invalid. But that all the same things may
so happen, shall in due place be demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, the fourth argument is set down by the
same Lucretius in these verses:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c027'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'><span lang="la">Duo de concursu corpora lata</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Si cita dissiliant, nempe aer omne necesse est,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Inter corpora quod fuerat, possidat inane.</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Is porro quamvis circum celerantibus auris</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Occupet ille locum, deinde omnia possideantur.</span>--I. 385-91.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>That is, <i>if two flat bodies be suddenly pulled
asunder, of necessity the air must come between
them to fill up the space they left empty. But
with what celerity soever the air flow in, yet it
cannot in one instant of time fill the whole space,
but first one part of it, then successively all</i>.
Which nevertheless is more repugnant to the opinion
of Epicurus, than of those that deny vacuum.
For though it be true, that if two bodies were of
infinite hardness, and were joined together by their
superficies which were most exactly plane, it would
be impossible to pull them asunder, in regard it
could not be done but by motion in an instant;
yet, if as the greatest of all magnitudes cannot be
given, nor the swiftest of all motions, so neither
the hardest of all bodies; it might be, that by the
application of very great force, there might be
place made for a successive flowing in of the air,
namely, by separating the parts of the joined
bodies by succession, beginning at the outermost
and ending at the innermost part. He ought,
therefore, first to have proved, that there are some
bodies extremely hard, not relatively as compared
with softer bodies, but absolutely, that is to say,
infinitely hard; which is not true. But if we suppose,
as Epicurus doth, that atoms are indivisible,
and yet have small superficies of their own; then
if two bodies should be joined together by many,
or but one only small superficies of either of them,
then I say this argument of Lucretius would be a
firm demonstration, that no two bodies made up
of atoms, as he supposes, could ever possibly be
pulled asunder by any force whatsoever. But this
is repugnant to daily experience.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Other arguments for the establishing of vacuum, invalid.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span><a id='art26.4'></a>4. And thus much of the arguments of Lucretius.
Let us now consider the arguments which are
drawn from the experiments of later writers.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='fss'>I.</span> The first experiment is this: that if a hollow
vessel be thrust into water with the bottom upwards,
the water will ascend into it; which they
say it could not do, unless the air within were thrust
together into a narrower place; and that this were
also impossible, except there were little empty
places in the air. Also, that when the air is compressed
to a certain degree, it can receive no further
compression, its small particles not suffering themselves
to be pent into less room. This reason, if
the air could not pass through the water as it
ascends within the vessel, might seem valid. But
it is sufficiently known, that air will penetrate
water by the application of a force equal to the
gravity of the water. If therefore the force, by
which the vessel is thrust down, be greater or
equal to the endeavour by which the water naturally
tendeth downwards, the air will go out that
way where the resistance is made, namely, towards
the edges of the vessel. For, by how much the
deeper is the water which is to be penetrated, so
much greater must be the depressing force. But
after the vessel is quite under water, the force by
which it is depressed, that is to say, the force by
which the water riseth up, is no longer increased.
There is therefore such an equilibration between
them, as that the natural endeavour of the water
downwards is equal to the endeavour by which
the same water is to be penetrated to the increased
depth.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='fss'>II.</span> The second experiment is, that if a concave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>cylinder of sufficient length, made of glass, that
the experiment may be the better seen, having
one end open and the other close shut, be filled
with quicksilver, and the open end being stopped
with one's finger, be together with the finger
dipped into a dish or other vessel, in which
also there is quicksilver, and the cylinder be set
upright, we shall, the finger being taken away to
make way for the descent of the quicksilver, see it
descend into the vessel under it, till there be only
so much remaining within the cylinder as may fill
about twenty-six inches of the same; and thus it
will always happen whatsoever be the cylinder,
provided that the length be not less than twenty-six
inches. From whence they conclude that the
cavity of the cylinder above the quicksilver remains
empty of all body. But in this experiment I find
no necessity at all of vacuum. For when the
quicksilver which is in the cylinder descends, the
vessel under it must needs be filled to a greater
height, and consequently so much of the contiguous
air must be thrust away as may make place
for the quicksilver which is descended. Now if it
be asked whither that air goes, what can be answered
but this, that it thrusteth away the next
air, and that the next, and so successively, till
there be a return to the place where the propulsion
first began. And there, the last air thus thrust
on will press the quicksilver in the vessel with the
same force with which the first air was thrust away;
and if the force with which the quicksilver descends
be great enough, which is greater or less as it
descends from a place of greater or less height, it
will make the air penetrate the quicksilver in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>vessel, and go up into the cylinder to fill the place
which they thought was left empty. But because
the quicksilver hath not in every degree of height
force enough to cause such penetration, therefore
in descending it must of necessity stay somewhere,
namely, there, where its endeavour downwards,
and the resistance of the same to the penetration
of the air, come to an equilibrium. And by this experiment
it is manifest, that this equilibrium will be
at the height of twenty-six inches, or thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='fss'>III.</span> The third experiment is, that when a vessel
hath as much air in it as it can naturally contain,
there may nevertheless be forced into it as much
water as will fill three quarters of the same vessel.
<a id='fig26.2'></a>And the experiment is made in this manner. Into
the glass bottle, represented (in <a href='#fig26.f2'>figure 2</a>) by the
sphere F G, whose centre is A, let the pipe B A C
be so fitted, that it may precisely fill the mouth of
the bottle; and let the end B be so near the bottom,
that there may be only space enough left for
the free passage of the water which is thrust in
above. Let the upper end of this pipe have a
cover at D, with a spout at E, by which the water,
when it ascends in the pipe, may run out. Also let
H C be a cock, for the opening or shutting of the
passage of the water between B and D, as there
shall be occasion. Let the cover D E be taken off,
and the cock H C being opened, let a syringe full
of water be forced in; and before the syringe be
taken away, let the cock be turned to hinder the
going out of the air. And in this manner let the
injection of water be repeated as often as it shall
be requisite, till the water rise within the bottle;
for example, to G F. Lastly, the cover being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>fastened on again, and the cock H C opened, the
water will run swiftly out at E, and sink by little
and little from G F to the bottom of the pipe B.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this phenomenon, they argue for the necessity
of vacuum in this manner. The bottle, from
the beginning, was full of air; which air could
neither go out by penetrating so great a length of
water as was injected by the pipe, nor by any other
way. Of necessity, therefore, all the water as high
as F G, as also all the air that was in the bottle
before the water was forced in, must now be in the
same place, which at first was filled by the air
alone; which were impossible, if all the space
within the bottle were formerly filled with air precisely,
that is, without any vacuum. Besides,
though some man perhaps may think the air, being
a thin body, may pass through the body of the
water contained in the pipe, yet from that other
phenomenon, namely, that all the water which is
in the space B F G is cast out again by the spout at
E, for which it seems impossible that any other
reason can be given besides the force by which the
air frees itself from compression, it follows, that
either there was in the bottle some space empty,
or that many bodies may be together in the same
place. But this last is absurd; and therefore the
former is true, namely, that there was vacuum.</p>

<p class='c001'>This argument is infirm in two places. For first,
that is assumed which is not to be granted; and
in the second place, an experiment is brought,
which I think is repugnant to vacuum. That
which is assumed is, that the air can have no passage
out through the pipe. Nevertheless, we see
daily that air easily ascends from the bottom to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>superficies of a river, as is manifest by the bubbles
that rise; nor doth it need any other cause to give
it this motion, than the natural endeavour downwards
of the water. Why, therefore, may not the
endeavour upwards of the same water, acquired by
the injection, which endeavour upwards is greater
than the natural endeavour of the water downwards,
cause the air in the bottle to penetrate in
like manner the water that presseth it downwards;
especially, seeing the water, as it riseth in the
bottle, doth so press the air that is above it, as that
it generateth in every part thereof an endeavour
towards the external superficies of the pipe, and
consequently maketh all the parts of the enclosed
air to tend directly towards the passage at B? I
say, this is no less manifest, than that the air which
riseth up from the bottom of a river should penetrate
the water, how deep soever it be. Wherefore
I do not yet see any cause why the force, by which
the water is injected, should not at the same time
eject the air.</p>

<p class='c001'>And as for their arguing the necessity of vacuum
from the rejection of the water; in the first place,
supposing there is vacuum, I demand by what
principle of motion that ejection is made. Certainly,
seeing this motion is from within outwards, it must
needs be caused by some agent within the bottle;
that is to say, by the air itself. Now the motion
of that air, being caused by the rising of the water,
begins at the bottom, and tends upwards; whereas
the motion by which it ejecteth the water ought to
begin above, and tend downwards. From whence
therefore hath the enclosed air this endeavour towards
the bottom? To this question I know not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>what answer can be given, unless it be said, that
the air descends of its own accord to expel the
water. Which, because it is absurd, and that the
air, after the water is forced in, hath as much room
as its magnitude requires, there will remain no
cause at all why the water should be forced out.
Wherefore the assertion of vacuum is repugnant
to the very experiment which is here brought to
establish it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many other phenomena are usually brought for
vacuum, as those of <em>weather-glasses</em>, <span lang="la"><i>æolipyles</i></span>,
<em>wind-guns</em>, &#38;c. which would all be very hard to be
salved, unless water be penetrable by air, without
the intermixture of empty space. But now, seeing
air may with no great endeavour pass through not
only water, but any other fluid body though never
so stubborn, as quicksilver, these phenomena prove
nothing. Nevertheless, it might in reason be
expected, that he that would take away vacuum,
should without vacuum show us such causes of
these phenomena, as should be at least of equal, if
not greater probability. This therefore shall be
done in the following discourse, when I come to
speak of these phenomena in their proper places.
But first, the most general hypotheses of natural
philosophy are to be premised.</p>

<p class='c001'>And seeing that suppositions are put for the true
causes of apparent effects, every supposition, except
such as be absurd, must of necessity consist of
some supposed possible motion; for rest can never
be the efficient cause of anything; and motion supposeth
bodies moveable; of which there are three
kinds, <em>fluid</em>, <em>consistent</em>, and <em>mixed of both</em>. <em>Fluid</em>
are those, whose parts may by very weak endeavour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>be separated from one another; and <em>consistent</em>
those for the separation of whose parts greater
force is to be applied. There are therefore degrees
of consistency; which degrees, by comparison
with more or less consistent, have the
names of <em>hardness</em> or <em>softness</em>. Wherefore a fluid
body is always divisible into bodies equally fluid,
as quantity into quantities; and soft bodies, of
whatsoever degree of softness, into soft bodies of
the same degree. And though many men seem to
conceive no other difference of <em>fluidity</em>, but such
as ariseth from the different magnitudes of the
parts, in which sense dust, though of diamonds,
may be called fluid; yet I understand by <em>fluidity</em>,
that which is made such by nature equally in every
part of the fluid body; not as dust is fluid, for so
a house which is falling in pieces may be called
fluid; but in such manner as water seems fluid,
and to divide itself into parts perpetually fluid.
And this being well understood, I come to my
suppositions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Six suppositions for the salving of the phenomena of nature.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art26.5'></a>5. First, therefore, I suppose that the immense
space, which we call the world, is the aggregate of
all bodies which are either consistent and visible,
as the earth and the stars; or invisible, as the
small atoms which are disseminated through the
whole space between the earth and the stars; and
lastly, that most fluid ether, which so fills all the
rest of the universe, as that it leaves in it no empty
place at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, I suppose with Copernicus, that the
greater bodies of the world, which are both consistent
and permanent, have such order amongst
themselves, as that the sun hath the first place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>Mercury the second, Venus the third, the Earth
with the moon going about it the fourth, Mars the
fifth, Jupiter with his attendants the sixth, Saturn
the seventh; and after these, the fixed stars have
their several distances from the sun.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirdly, I suppose that in the sun and the rest
of the planets there is and always has been a
simple circular motion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fourthly, I suppose that in the body of the air
there are certain other bodies intermingled, which
are not fluid; but withal that they are so small,
that they are not perceptible by sense; and that
these also have their proper simple motion, and
are some of them more, some less hard or consistent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fifthly, I suppose with Kepler that as the distance
between the sun and the earth is to the
distance between the moon and the earth, so the
distance between the moon and the earth is to the
semidiameter of the earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the magnitude of the circles, and the
times in which they are described by the bodies
which are in them, I will suppose them to be such
as shall seem most agreeable to the phenomena in
question.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Possible causes of the motions annual and diurnal; and of the apparent direction, station, and retrogradation of the planets.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art26.6'></a>6. The causes of the different seasons of the
year, and of the several variations of days and
nights in all the parts of the superficies of the
earth, have been demonstrated, first by Copernicus,
and since by Kepler, Galileus, and others,
from the supposition of the earth's diurnal revolution
about its own axis, together with its annual
motion about the sun in the ecliptic according to
the order of the signs; and thirdly, by the annual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>revolution of the same earth about its own centre,
contrary to the order of the signs. I suppose with
Copernicus, that the diurnal revolution is from the
motion of the earth, by which the equinoctial
circle is described about it. And as for the other
two annual motions, they are the efficient cause of
the earth's being carried about in the ecliptic in
such manner, as that its axis is always kept parallel
to itself. Which parallelism was for this reason
introduced, lest by the earth's annual revolution
its poles should seem to be necessarily carried
about the sun, contrary to experience. I have, in
<a href='#art21.10'>art. 10</a>, chap. <span class='fss'>XXI</span>, demonstrated, from the supposition
of simple circular motion in the sun, that the
earth is so carried about the sun, as that its axis is
thereby kept always parallel to itself. Wherefore,
from these two supposed motions in the sun, the
one simple circular motion, the other circular
motion about its own centre, it may be demonstrated
that the year hath both the same variations
of days and nights, as have been demonstrated by
Copernicus.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig26.3'></a>For if the circle <i>a b c d</i> (in <a href='#fig26.f3'>fig. 3</a>) be the ecliptic,
whose centre is <i>e</i>, and diameter <i>a e c</i>; and the
earth be placed in <i>a</i>, and the sun be moved in the
little circle <i>f g h i</i>, namely, according to the order
<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, and <i>i</i>, it hath been demonstrated, that a
body placed in <i>a</i> will be moved in the same order
through the points of the ecliptic <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>,
and will always keep its axis parallel to itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if, as I have supposed, the earth also be
moved with simple circular motion in a plane that
passeth through <i>a</i>, cutting the plane of the ecliptic
so as that the common section of both the planes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>be in <i>a c</i>, thus also the axis of the earth will be
kept always parallel to itself. For let the centre
of the earth be moved about in the circumference
of the epicycle, whose diameter is <i>l a k</i>, which is a
part of the strait line <i>l a c</i>; therefore <i>l a k</i>, the
diameter of the epicycle, passing through the
centre of the earth, will be in the plane of the
ecliptic. Wherefore seeing that by reason of the
earth's simple motion both in the ecliptic and in
its epicycle, the strait line <i>l a k</i> is kept always
parallel to itself, every other strait line also taken
in the body of the earth, and consequently its axis,
will in like manner be kept always parallel to
itself; so that in what part soever of the ecliptic
the centre of the epicycle be found, and in what
part soever of the epicycle the centre of the earth
be found at the same time, the axis of the earth
will be parallel to the place where the same axis
would have been, if the centre of the earth had
never gone out of the ecliptic.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now as I have demonstrated the simple annual
motion of the earth from the supposition of simple
motion in the sun; so from the supposition of
simple motion in the earth may be demonstrated
the monthly simple motion of the moon. For if
the names be but changed, the demonstration will
be the same, and therefore need not be repeated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The supposition of simple motion, why likely.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art26.7'></a>7. That which makes this supposition of the
sun's simple motion in the epicycle <i>f g h i</i> probable,
is first, that the periods of all the planets
are not only described about the sun, but so described,
as that they are all contained within the
zodiac, that is to say, within the latitude of about
sixteen degrees; for the cause of this seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>depend upon some power in the sun, especially in
that part of the sun which respects the zodiac.
Secondly, that in the whole compass of the heavens
there appears no other body from which the cause
of this phenomenon can in probability be derived.
Besides, I could not imagine that so many and such
various motions of the planets should have no
dependance at all upon one another. But, by supposing
motive power in the sun, we suppose motion
also; for power to move without motion is no
power at all. I have therefore supposed that there
is in the sun for the governing of the primary
planets, and in the earth for the governing of the
moon, such motion, as being received by the primary
planets and by the moon, makes them necessarily
appear to us in such manner as we see them.
Whereas, that circular motion, which is commonly
attributed to them, about a fixed axis, which is
called conversion, being a motion of their parts
only, and not of their whole bodies, is insufficient
to salve their appearances. For seeing whatsoever
is so moved, hath no endeavour at all towards those
parts which are without the circle, they have no
power to propagate any endeavour to such bodies
as are placed without it. And as for them that
suppose this may be done by magnetical virtue, or
by incorporeal and immaterial species, they suppose
no natural cause; nay, no cause at all. For
there is no such thing as an incorporeal movent,
and magnetical virtue is a thing altogether unknown;
and whensoever it shall be known, it will
be found to be a motion of body. It remains,
therefore, that if the primary planets be carried
about by the sun, and the moon by the earth, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>have the simple circular motions of the sun and
the earth for the causes of their circulations.
Otherwise, if they be not carried about by the sun
and the earth, but that every planet hath been
moved, as it is now moved, ever since it was
made, there will be of their motions no cause
natural. For either these motions were concreated
with their bodies, and their cause is supernatural;
or they are coeternal with them, and so they have
no cause at all. For whatsoever is eternal was
never generated.</p>

<p class='c001'>I may add besides, to confirm the probability of
this simple motion, that as almost all learned men
are now of the same opinion with Copernicus concerning
the parallelism of the axis of the earth, it
seemed to me to be more agreeable to truth, or at
least more handsome, that it should be caused by
simple circular motion alone, than by two motions,
one in the ecliptic, and the other about the earth's
own axis the contrary way, neither of them simple,
nor either of them such as might be produced by
any motion of the sun. I thought best therefore
to retain this hypothesis of simple motion, and
from it to derive the causes of as many of the
phenomena as I could, and to let such alone as I
could not deduce from thence.</p>

<p class='c001'>It will perhaps be objected, that although by
this supposition the reason may be given of the
parallelism of the axis of the earth, and of many
other appearances, nevertheless, seeing it is done
by placing the body of the sun in the centre of that
orb which the earth describes with its annual motion,
the supposition itself is false; because this
annual orb is eccentric to the sun. In the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>place, therefore, let us examine what that eccentricity
is, and whence it proceeds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of the eccentricity of the annual motion of the earth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art26.8'></a>8. Let the annual circle of the earth <i>a b c d</i> (in
<a href='#fig26.f3'>fig. 3</a>) be divided into four equal parts by the strait
lines <i>a c</i> and <i>b d</i>, cutting one another in the centre
<i>e</i>; and let <i>a</i> be the beginning of Libra, <i>b</i> of Capricorn,
<i>c</i> of Aries and <i>d</i> of Cancer; and let the
whole orb <i>a b c d</i> be understood, according to Copernicus,
to have every way so great distance from
the zodiac of the fixed stars, that it be in comparison
with it but as a point. Let the earth be now
supposed to be in the beginning of Libra at <i>a</i>.
The sun, therefore, will appear in the beginning
of Aries at <i>c</i>. Wherefore, if the earth be moved
from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, the apparent motion of the sun will be
from <i>c</i> to the beginning of Cancer in <i>d</i>; and the
earth being moved forwards from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, the sun
also will appear to be moved forwards to the beginning
of Libra in <i>a</i>; wherefore <i>c d a</i> will be the
summer arch, and the winter arch will be <i>a b c</i>.
Now, in the time, of the sun's apparent motion in
the summer arch, there are numbered 186¾ days;
and, consequently, the earth makes in the same
time the same number of diurnal conversions in
the arch <i>a b c</i>; and, therefore, the earth in its motion
through the arch <i>c d a</i> will make only 178½
diurnal conversions. Wherefore the arch <i>a b c</i>
ought to be greater than the arch <i>c d a</i> by 8¼ days,
that is to say, by almost so many degrees. Let
the arch <i>a r</i>, as also <i>c s</i>, be each of them an arch
of two degrees and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub>. Wherefore the arch
<i>r b s</i> will be greater than the semicircle <i>a b c</i>
by 4⅛ degrees, and greater than the arch <i>s d r</i>
by 8¼ degrees. The equinoxes, therefore, will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>in the points <i>r</i> and <i>s</i>; and therefore also, when
the earth is in <i>r</i>, the sun will appear in <i>s</i>.  Wherefore
the true place of the sun will be in <i>t</i>, that is
to say, without the centre of the earth's annual
motion by the quantity of the sine of the arch <i>a r</i>,
or the sine of two degrees and 16 minutes. Now
this sine, putting 100,000 for the radius, will be
near 3580 parts thereof. And so much is the eccentricity
of the earth's annual motion, provided
that that motion be in a perfect circle; and <i>s</i> and
<i>r</i> are the equinoctial parts. And the strait lines
<i>s r</i> and <i>c a</i>, produced both ways till they reach the
zodiac of the fixed stars, will fall still upon the same
fixed stars; because the whole orb <i>a b c d</i> is supposed
to have no magnitude at all in respect of
the great distance of the fixed stars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Supposing now the sun to be in <i>c</i>, it remains
that I show the cause why the earth is nearer to
the sun, when in its annual motion it is found to
be in <i>d</i>, than when it is in <i>b</i>. And I take the cause
to be this. When the earth is in the beginning of
Capricorn at <i>b</i>, the sun appears in the beginning
of Cancer at <i>d</i>; and then is the midst of summer.
But in the midst of summer, the northern parts of
the earth are towards the sun, which is almost all
dry land, containing all Europe and much the
greatest part of Asia and America. But when the
earth is in the beginning of Cancer at <i>d</i>, it is the
midst of winter, and that part of the earth is towards
the sun, which contains those great seas called the
South Sea and the Indian Sea, which are of far
greater extent than all the dry land in that hemisphere.
Wherefore by the last <a href='#art21.11'>article</a> of chapter
<span class='fss'>XXI</span>, when the earth is in <i>d</i>, it will come nearer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>its first movent, that is, to the sun which is in <i>t</i>;
that is to say, the earth is nearer to the sun in the
midst of winter when it is in <i>d</i>, than in the midst
of summer when it is in <i>b</i>; and, therefore, during
the winter the sun is in its <span lang="la"><i>Perigæum</i></span>, and in its
<span lang="la"><i>Apogæum</i></span> during the summer. And thus I have
shown a possible cause of the eccentricity of the
earth; which was to be done.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am, therefore, of Kepler's opinion in this, that
he attributes the eccentricity of the earth to the
difference of the parts thereof, and supposes one
part to be affected, and another disaffected to the
sun. And I dissent from him in this, that he thinks
it to be by magnetic virtue, and that this magnetic
virtue or attraction and thrusting back of the earth
is wrought by immateriate species; which cannot
be, because nothing can give motion but a body
moved and contiguous. For if those bodies be not
moved which are contiguous to a body unmoved,
how this body should begin to be moved is not
imaginable; as has been demonstrated in <a href='#art9.7'>art. 7</a>,
chap. <span class='fss'>IX</span>, and often inculcated in other places, to
the end that philosophers might at last abstain from
the use of such unconceivable connexions of words.
I dissent also from him in this, that he says the
similitude of bodies is the cause of their mutual
attraction. For if it were so, I see no reason why
one egg should not be attracted by another. If,
therefore, one part of the earth be more affected
by the sun than another part, it proceeds from
this, that one part hath more water, the other more
dry land. And from hence it is, as I showed above,
that the earth comes nearer to the sun when it
shines upon that part where there is more water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>than when it shines upon that where there is more
dry land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause why the moon hath always one and the same face turned towards the earth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art26.9'></a>9. This eccentricity of the earth is the cause
why the way of its annual motion is not a perfect
circle, but either an elliptical, or almost an elliptical
line; as also why the axis of the earth is not
kept exactly parallel to itself in all places, but only
in the equinoctial points.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now seeing I have said that the moon is carried
about by the earth, in the same manner that the
earth is by the sun; and that the earth goeth about
the sun in such manner as that it shows sometimes
one hemisphere, sometimes the other to the sun;
it remains to be enquired, why the moon has
always one and the same face turned towards the
earth.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig26.4'></a>Suppose, therefore, the sun to be moved with
simple motion in the little circle <i>f g h i</i>, (in <a href='#fig26.f4'>fig. 4</a>)
whose centre is <i>t</i>; and let ♈ ♋ ♎ ♑ be the annual
circle of the earth; and <i>a</i> the beginning of Libra.
About the point <i>a</i> let the little circle <i>l k</i> be described;
and in it let the centre of the earth be
understood to be moved with simple motion; and
both the sun and the earth to be moved according
to the order of the signs. Upon the centre <i>a</i> let the
way of the moon <i>m n o p</i> be described; and let <i>q r</i>
be the diameter of a circle cutting the globe of the
moon into two hemispheres, whereof one is seen by
us when the moon is at the full, and the other is
turned from us.</p>

<p class='c001'>The diameter therefore of the moon <i>q o r</i> will be
perpendicular to the strait line <i>t a</i>. Wherefore the
moon is carried, by reason of the motion of the
earth, from <i>o</i> towards <i>p</i>. But by reason of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>motion of the sun, if it were in <i>p</i> it would at the
same time be carried from <i>p</i> towards <i>o</i>; and by
these two contrary movents the strait line <i>q r</i> will
be turned about; and, in a quadrant of the circle
<i>m n o p</i>, it will be turned so much as makes the
fourth part of its whole conversion. Wherefore
when the moon is in <i>p</i>, <i>q r</i> will be parallel to the
strait line <i>m o</i>. Secondly, when the moon is in <i>m</i>,
the strait line <i>q r</i> will, by reason of the motion
of the earth, be in <i>m o</i>. But by the working of the
sun's motion upon it in the quadrant <i>p m</i>, the same
<i>q r</i> will be turned so much as makes another quarter
of its whole conversion. When, therefore, the moon
is in <i>m</i>, <i>q r</i> will be perpendicular to the strait line
<i>o m</i>. By the same reason, when the moon is in <i>n</i>,
<i>q r</i> will be parallel to the strait line <i>m o</i>; and, the
moon returning to <i>o</i>, the same <i>q r</i> will return to
its first place; and the body of the moon will in
one entire period make also one entire conversion
upon her own axis. In the making of which, it is
manifest, that one and the same face of the moon
is always turned towards the earth. And if any
diameter were taken in that little circle, in which
the moon were supposed to be carried about with
simple motion, the same effect would follow;
for if there were no action from the sun, every
diameter of the moon would be carried about
always parallel to itself. Wherefore I have given
a possible cause why one and the same face of the
moon is always turned towards the earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is to be noted, that when the moon is
without the ecliptic, we do not always see the same
face precisely. For we see only that part which is
illuminated. But when the moon is without the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>ecliptic, that part which is towards us is not exactly
the same with that which is illuminated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of the tides of the ocean.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art26.10'></a>10. To these three simple motions, one of the
sun, another of the moon, and the third of the
earth, in their own little circles <i>f g h i</i>, <i>l k</i>, and
<i>q r</i>, together with the diurnal conversion of the
earth, by which conversion all things that adhere
to its superficies are necessarily carried about with
it, may be referred the three phenomena concerning
the tides of the ocean. Whereof the first is
the alternate elevation and depression of the water
at the shores, twice in the space of twenty-four hours
and near upon fifty-two minutes; for so it has
constantly continued in all ages. The second, that
at the new and full moons, the elevations of the
water are greater than at other times between.
And the third, that when the sun is in the equinoctial,
they are yet greater than at any other
time. For the salving of which phenomena, we
have already the four above-mentioned motions;
to which I assume also this, that the part of the
earth which is called America, being higher than
the water, and extended almost the space of a
whole semicircle from north to south, gives a stop
to the motion of the water.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being granted, in the same <a href='#fig26.f4'>4th figure</a>, where
<i>l b k c</i> is supposed to be in the plane of the moon's
monthly motion, let the little circle <i>l d k e</i> be described
about the same centre <i>a</i> in the plane of the
equinoctial. This circle therefore will decline from
the circle <i>l b k c</i> in an angle of almost 28½ degrees;
for the greatest declination of the ecliptic is 23½,
to which adding 5 for the greatest declination of
the moon from the ecliptic, the sum will be 28½
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>degrees. Seeing now the waters, which are
under the circle of the moon's course, are by
reason of the earth's simple motion in the plane of
the same circle moved together with the earth, that
is to say, together with their own bottoms, neither
outgoing nor outgone; if we add the diurnal
motion, by which the other waters which are under
the equinoctial are moved in the same order, and
consider withal that the circles of the moon and
of the equinoctial intersect one another; it will be
manifest, that both those waters, which are under
the circle of the moon, and under the equinoctial,
will run together under the equinoctial; and consequently,
that their motion will not only be swifter
than the ground that carries them; but also that
the waters themselves will have greater elevation
whensoever the earth is in the equinoctial. Wherefore,
whatsoever the cause of the tides may be,
this may be the cause of their augmentation at
that time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, seeing I have supposed the moon to be
carried about by the simple motion of the earth in
the little circle <i>l b k c</i>; and demonstrated, at the
<a href='#art21.4'>4th article</a> of chapter <span class='fss'>XXI</span>, that whatsoever is
moved by a movent that hath simple motion, will
be moved always with the same velocity; it follows,
that the centre of the earth will be carried in the
circumference <i>l b k c</i> with the same velocity with
which the moon is carried in the circumference
<i>m n o p</i>. Wherefore the time, in which the moon
is carried about in <i>m n o p</i>, is to the time, in which
the earth is carried about in <i>l b k c</i>, as one circumference
to the other, that is, as <i>a o</i> to <i>a k</i>. But
<i>a o</i> is observed to be to the semidiameter of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>earth as 59 to 1; and therefore the earth, if <i>a k</i> be
put for its semidiameter, will make fifty-nine <a id='corr439.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='revotions'>revolutions</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_439.2'><ins class='correction' title='revotions'>revolutions</ins></a></span>
in <i>l b k c</i> in the time that the moon makes
one monthly circuit in <i>m n o p</i>. But the moon
makes her monthly circuit in little more than
twenty-nine days. Wherefore the earth shall make
its circuit in the circumference <i>l b k c</i> in twelve
hours and a little more, namely, about twenty-six
minutes more; that is to say, it shall make two
circuits in twenty-four hours and almost fifty-two
minutes; which is observed to be the time between
the high-water of one day and the high-water of
the day following. Now the course of the waters
being hindered by the southern part of America,
their motion will be interrupted there; and consequently,
they will be elevated in those places,
and sink down again by their own weight, twice in
the space of twenty-four hours and fifty-two minutes.
And thus I have given a possible cause of
the diurnal reciprocation of the ocean.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now from this swelling of the ocean in those
parts of the earth, proceed the flowings and ebbings
in the Atlantic, Spanish, British, and German seas;
which though they have their set times, yet upon
several shores they happen at several hours of the
day. And they receive some augmentation from
the north, by reason that the shores of China and
Tartary, hindering the general course of the waters,
make them swell there, and discharge themselves
in part through the strait of Anian into the
Northern Ocean, and so into the German Sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the spring tides which happen at the
time of the new and full moons, they are caused
by that simple motion, which at the beginning I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>supposed to be always in the moon. For as, when
I showed the cause of the eccentricity of the earth,
I derived the elevation of the waters from the
simple motion of the sun; so the same may here be
derived from the simple motion of the moon. For
though from the generation of clouds, there appear
in the sun a more manifest power of elevating the
waters than in the moon; yet the power of increasing
moisture in vegetables and living creatures
appears more manifestly in the moon than in the
sun; which may perhaps proceed from this, that
the sun raiseth up greater, and the moon lesser
drops of water. Nevertheless, it is more likely,
and more agreeable to common observation, that
rain is raised not only by the sun, but also by the
moon; for almost all men expect change of weather
at the time of the conjunctions of the sun and
moon with one another and with the earth, more
than in the time of their quarters.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the last place, the cause why the spring tides
are greater at the time of the equinoxes hath been
already sufficiently declared in this article, where I
have demonstrated, that the two motions of the
earth, namely, its simple motion in the little circle
<i>l b k c</i>, and its diurnal motion in <i>l d k e</i>, cause
necessarily a greater elevation of waters when the
sun is about the equinoxes, than when he is in
other places. I have therefore given possible causes
of the phenomenon of the flowing and ebbing of
the ocean.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cause of the precession of the equinoxes.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art26.11'></a>11. As for the explication of the yearly <em>precession
of the equinoctial points</em>, we must remember
that, as I have already shown, the annual motion
of the earth is not in the circumference of a circle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>but of an ellipsis, or a line not considerably different
from that of an ellipsis. In the first place,
therefore, this elliptical line is to be described.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig26.5'></a>Let the ecliptic ♎ ♑ ♈ ♋ (in <a href='#fig26.f5'>fig. 5</a>) be divided
into four equal parts by the two strait lines <i>a b</i> and
♑ ♋, cutting one another at right angles in the
centre <i>c</i>. And taking the arch <i>b d</i> of two degrees
and sixteen minutes, let the strait line <i>d e</i> be
drawn parallel to <i>a b</i>, and cutting ♑ ♋ in <i>f</i>; which
being done, the eccentricity of the earth will be
<i>c f</i>. Seeing therefore the annual motion of the
earth is in the circumference of an ellipsis, of
which ♑ ♋ is the greater axis, <i>a b</i> cannot be the
lesser axis; for <i>a b</i> and ♑ ♋ are equal. Wherefore
the earth passing through <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, will either
pass above ♑, as through <i>g</i>, or passing through ♑,
will fall between <i>c</i> and <i>a</i>; it is no matter which.
Let it pass therefore through <i>g</i>; and let <i>g l</i> be
taken equal to the strait line ♑ ♋; and dividing
<i>g l</i> equally in <i>i</i>, <i>g i</i> will be equal to ♑ <i>f</i>, and <i>i l</i>
equal to <i>f</i> ♋; and consequently the point <i>i</i> will
cut the eccentricity <i>c f</i> into two equal parts; and
taking <i>i h</i> equal to <i>i f</i>, <i>h i</i> will be the whole
eccentricity. If now a strait line, namely, the
line ♎ <i>i</i> ♈, be drawn through <i>i</i> parallel to the
strait lines <i>a b</i> and <i>e d</i>, the way of the sun in
summer, namely, the arch ♎ <i>g</i> ♈, will be greater
than his way in winter, by 8¼ degrees. Wherefore
the true equinoxes will be in the strait line
♎ <i>i</i> ♈; and therefore the ellipsis of the earth's
annual motion will not pass through <i>a</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>l</i>;
but through ♎, <i>g</i>, ♈ and <i>l</i>. Wherefore the annual
motion of the earth is in the ellipsis ♎ <i>g</i> ♈ <i>l</i>; and
cannot be, the eccentricity being salved, in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>other line. And this perhaps is the reason, why
Kepler, against the opinion of all the astronomers
of former time, thought fit to bisect the eccentricity
of the earth, or, according to the ancients, of
the sun, not by diminishing the quantity of the
same eccentricity, (because the true measure of that
quantity is the difference by which the summer
arch exceeds the winter arch), but by taking for
the centre of the ecliptic of the great orb the point
<i>c</i> nearer to <i>f</i>, and so placing the whole great orb
as much nearer to the ecliptic of the fixed stars
towards ♋, as is the distance between <i>c</i> and <i>i</i>.
For seeing the whole great orb is but as a point in
respect of the immense distance of the fixed stars,
the two strait lines ♎ ♈ and <i>a b</i>, being produced
both ways to the beginnings of Aries and Libra,
will fall upon the same points of the sphere of the
fixed stars. Let therefore the diameter of the
earth <i>m n</i> be in the plane of the earth's annual
motion. If now the earth be moved by the sun's
simple motion in the circumference of the ecliptic
about the centre <i>i</i>, this diameter will be kept
always parallel to itself and to the strait line <i>g l</i>.
But seeing the earth is moved in the circumference
of an ellipsis without the ecliptic, the point <i>n</i>,
whilst it passeth through ♎ ♑ ♈, will go in a lesser
circumference than the point <i>m</i>; and consequently,
as soon as ever it begins to be moved, it will
lose its parallelism with the strait line ♑ ♋; so
that <i>m n</i> produced will at last cut the strait line
<i>g l</i> produced. And contrarily, as soon as <i>m n</i> is
past ♈, the earth making its way in the internal
elliptical line ♈ <i>l</i> ♎, the same <i>m n</i> produced towards
<i>m</i>, will cut <i>l g</i> produced. And when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>earth hath almost finished its whole circumference,
the same <i>m n</i> shall again make a right angle
with a line drawn from the centre <i>i</i>, a little short
of the point from which the earth began its motion.
And there the next year shall be one of the equinoctial
points, namely, near the end of ♍; the
other shall be opposite to it near the end of ♓.
And thus the points in which the days and nights
are made equal do every year fall back; but with
so slow a motion, that, in a whole year, it makes but
51 first minutes. And this relapse being contrary
to the order of the signs, is commonly called the
<em>precession of the equinoxes</em>. Of which I have
from my former suppositions deduced a possible
cause; which was to be done.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to what I have said concerning the
cause of the eccentricity of the earth; and according
to Kepler, who for the cause thereof supposeth one
part of the earth to be affected to the sun, the other
part to be disaffected; the apogæum and perigæum
of the sun should be moved every year in
the same order, and with the same velocity, with
which the equinoctial points are moved; and their
distance from them should always be the quadrant
of a circle; which seems to be otherwise. For
astronomers say, that the equinoxes are now, the
one about 28 degrees gone back from the first star
of Aries, the other as much from the beginning of
Libra; so that the apogæum of the sun or the
aphelium of the earth ought to be about the 28th
degree of Cancer. But it is reckoned to be in the
7th degree. Seeing, therefore, we have not sufficient
evidence of the ὁτί (that so it is,) it is in vain
to seek for the διότι (why it is so.) Wherefore, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>long as the motion of the apogæum is not observable
by reason of the slowness thereof, and as long
as it remains doubtful whether their distance from
the equinoctial points be more or less than a
quadrant precisely; so long it may be lawful for
me to think they proceed both of them with equal
velocity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Also, I do not at all meddle with the causes
of the eccentricities of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and
Mercury. Nevertheless, seeing the eccentricity of
the earth may, as I have shewn, be caused by the
unlike constitution of the several parts of the earth
which are alternately turned towards the sun, it
is credible also, that like effects may be produced
in these other planets from their having their superficies
of unlike parts.</p>

<p class='c001'>And this is all I shall say concerning Sidereal
Philosophy. And, though the causes I have here
supposed be not the true causes of these phenomena,
yet I have demonstrated that they are
sufficient to produce them, according to what I at
first propounded.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Of the immense magnitude of some bodies, and the unspeakable littleness of others.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.1'></a>1. Besides the stars, of which I have spoken in
the last chapter, whatsoever other bodies there be
in the world, they may be all comprehended under
the name of intersidereal bodies. And these I have
already supposed to be either the most fluid æther,
or such bodies whose parts have some degree of
cohesion. Now, these differ from one another in
their several <em>consistencies</em>, <em>magnitudes</em>, <em>motions</em>,
and <em>figures</em>. In consistency, I suppose some bodies
to be harder, others softer through all the several
degrees of <em>tenacity</em>. In magnitude, some to be
greater, others less, and many unspeakably little.
For we must remember that, by the understanding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>quantity is divisible into divisibles perpetually.
And, therefore, if a man could do as much with his
hands as he can with his understanding, he would
be able to take from any given magnitude a part
which should be less than any other magnitude
given. But the Omnipotent Creator of the world
can actually from a part of any thing take another
part, as far as we by our understanding can conceive
the same to be divisible. Wherefore there is
no impossible smallness of bodies. And what
hinders but that we may think this likely? For we
know there are some living creatures so small
that we can scarce see their whole bodies. Yet
even these have their young ones; their little veins
and other vessels, and their eyes so small as that
no microscope can make them visible. So that we
cannot suppose any magnitude so little, but that
our very supposition is actually exceeded by nature.
Besides, there are now such microscopes commonly
made, that the things we see with them appear
a hundred thousand times bigger than they
would do if we looked upon them with our bare
eyes. Nor is there any doubt but that by augmenting
the power of these microscopes (for it
may be augmented as long as neither matter nor
the hands of workmen are wanting) every one of
those hundred thousandth parts might yet appear
a hundred thousand times greater than they did
before. Neither is the smallness of some bodies
to be more admired than the vast greatness of
others. For it belongs to the same Infinite Power,
as well to augment infinitely as infinitely to diminish.
To make the great orb, namely, that whose
radius reacheth from the earth to the sun, but as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>point in respect of the distance between the sun
and the fixed stars; and, on the contrary, to make
a body so little, as to be in the same proportion
less than any other visible body, proceeds equally
from one and the same Author of Nature. But this
of the immense distance of the fixed stars, which
for a long time was accounted an incredible thing,
is now believed by almost all the learned. Why
then should not that other, of the smallness of some
bodies, become credible at some time or other?
For the Majesty of God appears no less in small
things than in great; and as it exceedeth human
sense in the immense greatness of the universe,
so also it doth in the smallness of the parts thereof.
Nor are the first elements of compositions, nor the
first beginnings of actions, nor the first moments
of times more credible, than that which is now
believed of the vast distance of the fixed stars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some things are acknowledged by mortal men
to be very great, though finite, as seeing them to
be such. They acknowledge also that some things,
which they do not see, may be of infinite magnitude.
But they are not presently nor without great
study persuaded, that there is any mean between
infinite and the greatest of those things which
either they see or imagine. Nevertheless, when
after meditation and contemplation many things
which we wondered at before are now grown more
familiar to us, we then believe them, and transfer
our admiration from the creatures to the Creator.
But how little soever some bodies may be, yet I
will not suppose their quantity to be less than is
requisite for the salving of the phenomena. And
in like manner I shall suppose their motion, namely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>their velocity and slowness, and the variety of their
figures, to be only such as the explication of their
natural causes requires. And lastly, I suppose,
that the parts of the pure æther, as if it were the
first matter, have no motion at all but what they
receive from bodies which float in them, and are
not themselves fluid.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the cause of the light of the sun.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.2'></a>2. Having laid these grounds, let us come to speak
of causes; and in the first place let us inquire what
may be the cause of the light of the sun. Seeing,
therefore, the body of the sun doth by its simple
circular motion thrust away the ambient ethereal
substance sometimes one way sometimes another,
so that those parts, which are next the sun, being
moved by it, do propagate that motion to the next
remote parts, and these to the next, and so on
continually; it must needs be that, notwithstanding
any distance, the foremost part of the eye
will at last be pressed; and by the pressure of
that part, the motion will be propagated to the
innermost part of the organ of sight, namely, to
the heart; and from the reaction of the heart, there
will proceed an endeavour back by the same way,
ending in the endeavour outwards of the coat of
the eye, called the <em>retina</em>. But this endeavour
outwards, as has been defined in chapter <a href='#ch25'><span class='fss'>XXV</span></a>, is
the thing which is called light, or the phantasm
of a lucid body. For it is by reason of this phantasm
that an object is called lucid. Wherefore
we have a possible cause of the light of the sun;
which I undertook to find.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How light heateth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.3'></a>3. The generation of the light of the sun is accompanied
with the generation of heat. Now
every man knows what heat is in himself, by feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>it when he grows hot; but what it is in other
things, he knows only by ratiocination. For it is
one thing to grow hot, and another thing to heat
or make hot. And therefore though we perceive
that the fire or the sun heateth, yet we do not
perceive that it is itself hot. That other living
creatures, whilst they make other things hot, are
hot themselves, we infer by reasoning from the
like sense in ourselves. But this is not a necessary
inference. For though it may truly be said of
living creatures, that <em>they heat, therefore they
are themselves hot</em>; yet it cannot from hence be
truly inferred that <em>fire heateth, therefore it is
itself hot</em>; no more than this, <em>fire causeth pain,
therefore it is itself in pain</em>. Wherefore, that is
only and properly called hot, which when we feel
we are necessarily hot.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now when we grow hot, we find that our spirits
and blood, and whatsoever is fluid within us, is
called out from the internal to the external parts
of our bodies, more or less, according to the degree
of the heat; and that our skin swelleth. He,
therefore, that can give a possible cause of this
evocation and swelling, and such as agrees with
the rest of the phenomena of heat, may be thought
to have given the cause of the heat of the sun.</p>

<p class='c001'>It hath been shown, in the <a href='#art21.5'>5th article</a> of chapter
<span class='fss'>XXI</span>, that the fluid medium, which we call the air,
is so moved by the simple circular motion of the
sun, as that all its parts, even the least, do perpetually
change places with one another; which
change of places is that which there I called fermentation.
From this fermentation of the air, I
have, in the <a href='#art26.8'>8th article</a> of the last chapter, demonstrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>that the water may be drawn up into the
clouds.</p>

<p class='c001'>And I shall now show that the fluid parts may,
in like manner, by the same fermentation, be drawn
out from the internal to the external parts of our
bodies. For seeing that wheresoever the fluid
medium is contiguous to the body of any living
creature, there the parts of that medium are, by
perpetual change of place, separated from one
another; the contiguous parts of the living creature
must, of necessity, endeavour to enter into the spaces
of the separated parts. For otherwise those parts,
supposing there is no vacuum, would have no place
to go into. And therefore that, which is most fluid
and separable in the parts of the living creature
which are contiguous to the medium, will go first
out; and into the place thereof will succeed such
other parts as can most easily transpire through
the pores of the skin. And from hence it is necessary
that the rest of the parts, which are not
separated, must altogether be moved outwards, for
the keeping of all places full. But this motion
outwards of all parts together must, of necessity,
press those parts of the ambient air which are
ready to leave their places; and therefore all the
parts of the body, endeavouring at once that way,
make the body swell. Wherefore a possible cause
is given of heat from the sun; which was to be
done.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The generation of fire from the sun.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.4'></a>4. We have now seen how light and heat are
generated; heat by the simple motion of the medium,
making the parts perpetually change places
with one another; and light by this, that by the
same simple motion action is propagated in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>strait line. But when a body hath its parts so
moved, that it sensibly both heats and shines at
the same time, then it is that we say fire is
generated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now by fire I do not understand a body distinct
from matter combustible or glowing, as wood or
iron, but the matter itself, not simply and always,
but then only when it shineth and heateth. He,
therefore, that renders a cause possible and agreeable
to the rest of the phenomena, namely, whence,
and from what action, both the <em>shining</em> and <em>heating</em>
proceed, may be thought to have given a possible
cause of the generation of <em>fire</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig27.1'></a>Let, therefore, A B C (in the <a href='#fig27.f1'>first figure</a>) be a
sphere, or the portion of a sphere, whose centre is
D; and let it be transparent and homogeneous, as
crystal, glass, or water, and objected to the sun.
Wherefore, the foremost part A B C will, by the
simple motion of the sun, by which it thrusts
forwards the medium, be wrought upon by the
sunbeams in the strait lines E A, F B, and G C;
which strait lines may, in respect of the great distance
of the sun, be taken for parallels. And
seeing the medium within the sphere is thicker
than the medium without it, those beams will be
refracted towards the perpendiculars. Let the
strait lines E A and G C be produced till they cut
the sphere in H and I; and drawing the perpendiculars
A D and C D, the refracted beams E A and
G C will of necessity fall, the one between A H
and A D, the other between C I and C D. Let
those refracted beams be A K and C L. And again,
let the lines D K M and D L N be drawn perpendicular
to the sphere; and let A K and C L be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>produced till they meet with the strait line B D
produced in O. Seeing, therefore, the medium
within the sphere is thicker than that without it,
the refracted line A K will recede further from the
perpendicular K M than K O will recede from the
same. Wherefore K O will fall between the refracted
line and the perpendicular. Let, therefore,
the refracted line be K P, cutting F O in P; and
for the same reason the strait line L P will be the
refracted line of the strait line C L. Wherefore,
seeing the beams are nothing else but the ways in
which the motion is propagated, the motion about
P will be so much more vehement than the motion
about A B C, by how much the base of the portion
A B C is greater than the base of a like portion in
the sphere, whose centre is P, and whose magnitude
is equal to that of the little circle about P, which
comprehendeth all the beams that are propagated
from A B C; and this sphere being much less than
the sphere A B C, the parts of the medium, that is,
of the air about P, will change places with one
another with much greater celerity than those
about A B C. If, therefore, any matter combustible,
that is to say, such as may be easily dissipated, be
placed in P, the parts of that matter, if the proportion
be great enough between A C and a like
portion of the little circle about P, will be freed
from their mutual cohesion, and being separated
will acquire simple motion. But vehement simple
motion generates in the beholder a phantasm of
lucid and hot, as I have before demonstrated of
the simple motion of the sun; and therefore the
combustible matter which is placed in P will be
made lucid and hot, that is to say, will be fire.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>Wherefore I have rendered a possible cause of fire;
which was to be done.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The generation of fire from collision.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.5'></a>5. From the manner by which the sun generateth
fire, it is easy to explain the manner by which fire
may be generated by the collision of two flints.
For by that collision some of those particles of
which the stone is compacted, are violently separated
and thrown off; and being withal swiftly
turned round, the eye is moved by them, as it is in
the generation of light by the sun. Wherefore they
shine; and falling upon matter which is already half
dissipated, such as is tinder, they thoroughly dissipate
the parts thereof, and make them turn round.
From whence, as I have newly shown, light and
heat, that is to say fire, is generated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of light in glow-worms, rotten wood, and the Bolognan stone.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.6'></a>6. The shining of glow-worms, some kinds of
rotten wood, and of a kind of stone made at Bologna,
may have one common cause, namely, the
exposing of them to the hot sun. We find by experience
that the Bologna stone shines not, unless it be
so exposed; and after it has been exposed it shines
but for a little time, namely, as long as it retains
a certain degree of heat. And the cause may be
that the parts, of which it is made, may together
with heat have simple motion imprinted in them
by the sun. Which if it be so, it is necessary that
it shine in the dark, as long as there is sufficient heat
in it; but this ceasing, it will shine no longer.
Also we find by experience that in the glow-worm
there is a certain thick humour, like the crystalline
humour of the eye; which if it be taken out and
held long enough in one's fingers, and then be
carried into the dark, it will shine by reason of the
warmth it received from the fingers; but as soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>as it is cold it will cease shining. From whence,
therefore, can these creatures have their light, but
from lying all day in the sunshine in the hottest
time of summer? In the same manner, rotten
wood, except it grow rotten in the sunshine, or be
afterwards long enough exposed to the sun, will
not shine. That this doth not happen in every
worm, nor in all kinds of rotten wood, nor in all
calcined stones, the cause may be that the parts,
of which the bodies are made, are different both
in motion and figure from the parts of bodies of
other kinds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of light in the concussion of sea water.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.7'></a>7. Also the sea water shineth when it is either
dashed with the strokes of oars, or when a ship in
its course breaks strongly through it; but more or
less, according as the wind blows from different
points. The cause whereof may be this, that the
particles of salt, though they never shine in the
salt-pits, where they are but slowly drawn up by
the sun, being here beaten up into the air in greater
quantities and with more force, are withal made
to turn round, and consequently to shine, though
weakly. I have, therefore, given a possible cause
of this phenomenon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of flame, sparks, &#38; colliquation.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.8'></a>8. If such matter as is compounded of hard little
bodies be set on fire, it must needs be, that, as they
fly out in greater or less quantities, the flame which
is made by them will be greater or less. And if
the ethereal or fluid part of that matter fly out
together with them, their motion will be the
swifter, as it is in wood and other things which
flame with a manifest mixture of wind. When,
therefore, these hard particles by their flying out
move the eye strongly, they shine bright; and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>great quantity of them flying out together, they
make a great shining body. For flame being
nothing but an aggregate of shining particles, the
greater the aggregate is, the greater and more
manifest will be the flame. I have, therefore,
shown a possible cause of flame. And from hence
the cause appears evidently, why glass is so easily
and quickly melted by the small flame of a candle
blown, which will not be melted without blowing
but by a very strong fire.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, if from the same matter there be a part
broken off, namely, such a part as consisteth of
many of the small particles, of this is made a spark.
For from the breaking off it hath a violent turning
round, and from hence it shines. But though
from this matter there fly neither flame nor sparks,
yet some of the smallest parts of it may be carried
out as far as to the superficies, and remain there
as ashes; the parts whereof are so extremely small,
that it cannot any longer be doubted how far nature
may proceed in dividing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, though by the application of fire to this
matter there fly little or nothing from it, yet
there will be in the parts an endeavour to simple
motion; by which the whole body will either be
melted, or, which is a degree of melting, softened.
For all motion has some effect upon all matter
whatsoever, as has been shown at <a href='#art15.3'>art. 3</a>, chap. <span class='fss'>XV</span>.
Now if it be softened to such a degree, as that the
stubbornness of the parts be exceeded by their
gravity, then we say it is melted; otherwise, softened
and made pliant and ductile.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, the matter having in it some particles
hard, others ethereal or watery; if, by the application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>of fire, these latter be called out, the former
will thereby come to a more full contact with one
another; and, consequently, will not be so easily
separated; that is to say, the whole body will be
made harder. And this may be the cause why the
same fire makes some things soft, others hard.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause why wet hay sometimes burns of its own accord; also the cause of lightning.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.9'></a>9. It is known by experience that if hay be laid
wet together in a heap, it will after a time begin
to smoke, and then burn as it were of itself. The
cause whereof seems to be this, that in the air,
which is enclosed within the hay, there are those
little bodies, which, as I have supposed, are moved
freely with simple motion. But this motion being
by degrees hindered more and more by the descending
moisture, which at the last fills and stops
all the passages, the thinner parts of the air ascend
by penetrating the water; and those hard little
bodies, being so thrust together that they touch
and press one another, acquire stronger motion;
till at last by the increased strength of this motion
the watery parts are first driven outwards, from
whence appears vapour; and by the continued
increase of this motion, the smallest particles of
the dried hay are forced out, and recovering their
natural simple motion, they grow hot and shine,
that is to say, they are set on fire.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same also may be the cause of lightning,
which happens in the hottest time of the year,
when the water is raised up in greatest quantity
and carried highest. For after the first clouds are
raised, others after others follow them; and being
congealed above, they happen, whilst some of them
ascend and others descend, to fall one upon another
in such manner, as that in some places all their parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>are joined together, in others they leave hollow
spaces between them; and into these spaces, the
ethereal parts being forced out by the compressure
of the clouds, many of the harder little bodies are
so pent together, as they have not the liberty of
such motion as is natural to the air. Wherefore
their endeavour grows more vehement, till at last
they force their way through the clouds, sometimes
in one place, sometimes in another; and, breaking
through with great noise, they move the air violently,
and striking our eyes, generate light, that
is to say, they shine. And this shining is that we
call lightning.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of the force of gunpowder; and what is to be ascribed to the coals, what to the brimstone, and what to the nitre.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.10'></a>10. The most common phenomenon proceeding
from fire, and yet the most admirable of all others,
is the force of gunpowder fired; which being compounded
of nitre, brimstone and coals, beaten small,
hath from the coals its first taking fire; from the
brimstone its nourishment and flame, that is to say,
light and motion, and from the nitre the vehemence
of both. Now if a piece of nitre, before it
is beaten, be laid upon a burning coal, first it melts,
and, like water, quencheth that part of the coal it
toucheth. Then vapour or air, flying out where the
coal and nitre join, bloweth the coal with great
swiftness and vehemence on all sides. And from
hence it comes to pass, that by two contrary motions,
the one, of the particles which go out of the
burning coal, the other, of those of the ethereal
and watery substance of the nitre, is generated
that vehement motion and inflammation. And,
lastly, when there is no more action from the nitre,
that is to say, when the volatile parts of the nitre
are flown out, there is found about the sides a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>white substance, which being thrown again
into the fire, will grow red-hot again, but will not
be dissipated, at least unless the fire be augmented.
If now a possible cause of this be found out, the
same will also be a possible cause why a grain of
gunpowder set on fire doth expand itself with
such vehement motion, and shine. And it may be
caused in this manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the particles, of which nitre consisteth, be
supposed to be some of them hard, others watery,
and the rest ethereal. Also let the hard particles
be supposed to be spherically hollow, like small
bubbles, so that many of them growing together
may constitute a body, whose little caverns are
filled with a substance which is either watery, or
ethereal, or both. As soon, therefore, as the hard
particles are dissipated, the watery and ethereal
particles will necessarily fly out; and as they fly,
of necessity blow strongly the burning coals and
brimstone which are mingled together; whereupon
there will follow a great expansion of light, with
vehement flame, and a violent dissipation of the
particles of the nitre, the brimstone and the coals.
Wherefore I have given a possible cause of the
force of fired gunpowder.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is manifest from hence, that for the rendering
of the cause why a bullet of lead or iron, shot from
a piece of ordnance, flies with so great velocity,
there is no necessity to introduce such rarefaction,
as, by the common definition of it, makes the
same matter to have sometimes more, sometimes
less quantity; which is inconceivable. For every
thing is said to be greater or less, as it hath more
or less quantity. The violence with which a bullet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>is thrust out of a gun, proceeds from the swiftness
of the small particles of the fired powder; at least
it may proceed from that cause without the supposition
of any empty space.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How heat is caused by attrition.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.11'></a>11. Besides, by the attrition or rubbing of one
body against another, as of wood against wood, we
find that not only a certain degree of heat, but fire
itself is sometimes generated. For such motion
is the reciprocation of pressure, sometimes one way,
sometimes the other; and by this reciprocation
whatsoever is fluid in both the pieces of wood is
forced hither and thither; and consequently, to an
endeavour of getting out; and at last by breaking
out makes fire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The distinction of light into first, second, &#38;c.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.12'></a>12. Now light is distinguished into, first, second,
third, and so on infinitely. And we call that first
light, which is in the first lucid body; as the sun,
fire, &#38;c.: second, that which is in such bodies, as
being not transparent are illuminated by the sun;
as the moon, a wall, &#38;c.: and third, that which is in
bodies not transparent, but illuminated by second
light, &#38;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The causes of the colours we see in looking through a prisma of glass, namely, of red, yellow, blue, &#38; violet colour.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.13'></a>13. <em>Colour</em> is light, but troubled light, namely,
such as is generated by perturbed motion; as shall
be made manifest by the red, yellow, blue and purple,
which are generated by the interposition of a
diaphanous prisma, whose opposite bases are
triangular, between the light and that which is
enlightened.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>[Discussion of <a href='#fig27.f2'>Figure 27.2</a>]</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig27.2'></a>For let there be a prisma of glass, or of any other
transparent matter which is of greater density than
air; and let the triangle A B C be the base of this
prisma. Also let the strait line D E be the diameter
of the sun's body, having oblique position to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>the strait line A B; and let the sunbeams pass in
the lines D A and E B C. And lastly, let the strait
lines D A and E C be produced indefinitely to F
and G. Seeing therefore the strait line D A, by
reason of the density of the glass, is refracted towards
the perpendicular; let the line refracted at
the point A be the strait line A H. And again,
seeing the medium below A C is thinner than that
above it, the other refraction, which will be made
there, will diverge from the perpendicular. Let
therefore this second refracted line be A I. Also
let the same be done at the point C, by making the
first refracted line to be C K, and the second C L.
Seeing therefore the cause of the refraction in the
point A of the strait line of A B is the excess of the
resistance of the medium in A B above the resistance
of the air, there must of necessity be reaction
from the point A towards the point B; and consequently
the medium at A within the triangle A B C
will have its motion troubled, that is to say, the
strait motion in A F and A H will be mixed with
the transverse motion between the same A F and
A H, represented by the short transverse lines in
the triangle A F H. Again, seeing at the point A
of the strait line A C there is a second refraction
from A H in A I, the motion of the medium will
again be perturbed by reason of the transverse reaction
from A towards C, represented likewise by
the short transverse lines in the triangle A H I.
And in the same manner there is a double perturbation
represented by the transverse lines in the
triangles C G K and C K L. But as for the light
between A I and C G, it will not be perturbed;
because, if there were in all the points of the strait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>lines A B and A C the same action which is in the
points A and C, then the plane of the triangle C G K
would be everywhere coincident with the plane of
the triangle A F H; by which means all would appear
alike between A and C. Besides, it is to be
observed, that all the reaction at A tends towards
the illuminated parts which are between A and C,
and consequently perturbeth the first light. And
on the contrary, that all the reaction at C tends
towards the parts without the triangle or without
the prisma A B C, where there is none but second
light; and that the triangle A F H shows that perturbation
of light which is made in the glass itself;
as the triangle A H I shows that perturbation of
light which is made below the glass. In like manner,
that C G K shows the perturbation of light within
the glass; and C K L that which is below the glass.
From whence there are four divers motions, or four
different illuminations or colours, whose differences
appear most manifestly to the sense in a prisma,
whose base is an equilateral triangle, when the
sunbeams that pass through it are received upon a
white paper. For the triangle A F H appears red
to the sense; the triangle A H I yellow; the triangle
C G K green, and approaching to blue; and
lastly, the triangle C K L appears purple. It is
therefore evident that when weak but first light
passeth through a more resisting diaphanous body,
as glass, the beams, which fall upon it transversely,
make redness; and when the same first light is
stronger, as it is in the thinner medium below the
strait line A C, the transverse beams make yellowness.
Also when second light is strong, as it is in
the triangle C G K, which is nearest to the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>light, the transverse beams make greenness; and
when the same second light is weaker, as in the
triangle C K L, they make a purple colour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Why the moon and the stars appear redder in the horizon than in the midst of the heaven.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.14'></a>14. From hence may be deduced a cause, why
the moon and stars appear bigger and redder near
the horizon than in the mid-heaven. For between
the eye and the apparent horizon there is more
impure air, such as is mingled with watery and
earthy little bodies, than is between the same eye
and the more elevated part of heaven. But vision
is made by beams which constitute a cone, whose
base, if we look upon the moon, is the moon's face,
and whose vertex is in the eye; and therefore,
many beams from the moon must needs fall upon
little bodies that are without the visual cone, and
be by them reflected to the eye. But these reflected
beams tend all in lines which are transverse to the
visual cone, and make at the eye an angle which is
greater than the angle of the cone. Wherefore,
the moon appears greater in the horizon, than when
she is more elevated. And because those reflected
beams go transversely, there will be generated, by
the last article, redness. A possible cause therefore
is shown, why the moon as also the stars appear
greater and redder in the horizon, than in the
midst of heaven. The same also may be the cause,
why the sun appears in the horizon greater and of
a colour more degenerating to yellow, than when
he is higher elevated. For the reflection from the
little bodies between, and the transverse motion of
the medium, are still the same. But the light of
the sun is much stronger than that of the moon;
and therefore, by the last article, his splendour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>must needs by this perturbation degenerate into
yellowness.</p>

<p class='c001'>But for the generation of these four colours, it is
not necessary that the figure of the glass be a
prisma; for if it were spherical it would do the
same. For in a sphere the sunbeams are twice
refracted and twice reflected. And this being observed
by Des Cartes, and withal that a rainbow
never appears but when it rains; as also, that the
drops of rain have their figures almost spherical; he
hath shown from thence the cause of the colours
in the rainbow; which therefore need not be
repeated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of whiteness.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.15'></a>15. <em>Whiteness</em> is light, but light perturbed by
the reflections of many beams of light coming to
the eye together within a little space. For if glass
or any other diaphanous body be reduced to very
small parts by contusion or concussion, every one
of those parts, if the beams of a lucid body be
from any one point of the same reflected to the eye,
will represent to the beholder an idea or image of
the whole lucid body, that is to say, a phantasm
of white. For the strongest light is the most white;
and therefore many such parts will make many
such images. Wherefore, if those parts lie thick
and close together, those many images will appear
confusedly, and will by reason of the confused light
represent a white colour. So that from hence
may be deduced a possible cause, why glass beaten,
that is, reduced to powder, looks white. Also why
water and snow are white; they being nothing but
a heap of very small diaphanous bodies, namely, of
little bubbles, from whose several convex superficies
there are by reflection made several confused phantasms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>of the whole lucid body, that is to say, whiteness.
For the same reason, salt and nitre are white,
as consisting of small bubbles which contain within
them water and air; as is manifest in nitre, from
this, that being thrown into the fire it violently
blows the same; which salt also doth, but with less
violence. But if a white body be exposed, not to
the light of the day, but to that of the fire or of a
candle, it will not at the first sight be easily judged
whether it be white or yellow; the cause whereof
may be this, that the light of those things, which
burn and flame, is almost of a middle colour between
whiteness and yellowness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of blackness.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art27.16'></a>16. As whiteness is light, so <em>blackness</em> is the privation
of light, or darkness. And, from hence it is,
first, that all holes, from which no light can be reflected
to the eye, appear black. Secondly, that
when a body hath little eminent particles erected
straight up from the superficies, so that the beams
of light which fall upon them are reflected not to
the eye but to the body itself, that superficies
appears black; in the same manner as the sea
appears <a id='corr464.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='back'>black</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_464.23'><ins class='correction' title='back'>black</ins></a></span> when ruffled by the wind. Thirdly,
that any combustible matter is by the fire made to
look black before it shines. For the endeavour of
the fire being to dissipate the smallest parts of such
bodies as are thrown into it, it must first raise and
erect those parts before it can work their dissipation.
If, therefore, the fire be put out before the
parts are totally dissipated, the coal will appear
black; for the parts being only erected, the beams
of light falling upon them will not be reflected to
the eye, but to the coal itself. Fourthly, that burning
glasses do more easily burn black things than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>white. For in a white superficies the eminent
parts are convex, like little bubbles; and therefore
the beams of light, which fall upon them, are
reflected every way from the reflecting body. But
in a black superficies, where the eminent particles
are more erected, the beams of light falling upon
them are all necessarily reflected towards the body
itself; and, therefore, bodies that are black are
more easily set on fire by the sun beams, than
those that are white. Fifthly, that all colours
that are made of the mixture of white and black
proceed from the different position of the particles
that rise above the superficies, and their different
forms of asperity. For, according to these differences,
more or fewer beams of light are reflected
from several bodies to the eye. But in regard
those differences are innumerable, and the bodies
themselves so small that we cannot perceive them;
the explication and precise determination of the
causes of all colours is a thing of so great difficulty,
that I dare not undertake it.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Why breath from the same mouth sometimes heats and sometimes cools.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.1'></a>1. As, when the motion of the ambient ethereal
substance makes the spirits and fluid parts of our
bodies tend outwards, we acknowledge heat; so,
by the endeavour inwards of the same spirits and
humours, we feel cold. So that to cool is to make
the exterior parts of the body endeavour inwards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>by a motion contrary to that of calefaction, by
which the internal parts are called outwards. He,
therefore, that would know the cause of cold, must
find by what motion or motions the exterior parts
of any body endeavour to retire inwards. To
begin with those phenomena which are the most
familiar. There is almost no man but knows, that
breath blown strongly, and which comes from the
mouth with violence, that is to say, the passage
being strait, will cool the hand; and that the
same breath blown gently, that is to say, through
a greater aperture, will warm the same. The
cause of which phenomenon may be this, the breath
going out hath two motions; the one, of the whole
and direct, by which the foremost parts of the
hand are driven inwards; the other, simple motion
of the small particles of the same breath, which,
(as I have shown in the <a href='#art28.3'>3rd article</a> of the last
chapter, causeth heat. According, therefore, as
either of these motions is predominant, so there is
the sense sometimes of cold, sometimes of heat.
Wherefore, when the breath is softly breathed out
at a large passage, that simple motion which causeth
heat prevaileth, and consequently heat is felt; and
when, by compressing the lips, the breath is more
strongly blown out, then is the direct motion prevalent,
which makes us feel cold. For, the direct
motion of the breath or air is wind; and all wind
cools or diminisheth former heat.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wind, and the inconstancy of winds, whence.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.2'></a>2. And seeing not only great wind, but almost
any ventilation and stirring of the air, doth refrigerate;
the reason of many experiments concerning
cold cannot well be given without finding first
what are the causes of wind. Now, wind is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>nothing else but the direct motion of the air thrust
forwards; which, nevertheless, when many winds
concur, may be circular or otherwise indirect, as
it is in whirlwinds. Wherefore, in the first place
we are to enquire into the causes of winds. Wind
is air moved in a considerable quantity, and that
either in the manner of waves, which is both forwards
and also up and down, or else forwards
only.</p>

<p class='c001'>Supposing, therefore, the air both clear and
calm for any time how little soever, yet, the
greater bodies of the world being so disposed and
ordered as has been said, it will be necessary that
a wind presently arise somewhere. For, seeing
that motion of the parts of the air, which is made
by the simple motion of the sun in his own epicycle,
causeth an exhalation of the particles of water
from the seas and all other moist bodies, and those
particles make clouds; it must needs follow, that,
whilst the particles of water pass upwards, the
particles of air, for the keeping of all spaces full,
be jostled out on every side, and urge the next particles,
and these the next; till having made their
circuit, there comes continually so much air to the
hinder parts of the earth as there went water from
before it. Wherefore, the ascending vapours move
the air towards the sides every way; and all direct
motion of the air being wind, they make a wind.
And if this wind meet often with other vapours
which arise in other places, it is manifest that the
force thereof will be augmented, and the way or
course of it changed. Besides, according as the
earth, by its diurnal motion, turns sometimes the
drier, sometimes the moister part towards the sun,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>so sometimes a greater, sometimes a less, quantity
of vapours will be raised; that is to say, sometimes
there will be a less, sometimes a greater wind.
Wherefore, I have rendered a possible cause of
such winds as are generated by vapours; and also
of their inconstancy.</p>

<p class='c001'>From hence it follows that these winds cannot
be made in any place, which is higher than that to
which vapours may ascend. Nor is that incredible
which is reported of the highest mountains, as the
Peak of Teneriffe and the Andes of Peru, namely,
that they are not at all troubled with these inconstant
winds. And if it were certain that neither
rain nor snow were ever seen in the highest tops
of those mountains, it could not be doubted but
that they are higher than any place to which
vapours use to ascend.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Why there is a constant, though not a great wind, from east to west, near the equator.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.3'></a>3. Nevertheless, there may be wind there, though
not that which is made by the ascent of vapours,
yet a less and more constant wind, like the continued
blast of a pair of bellows, blowing from the
east. And this may have a double cause; the one,
the diurnal motion of the earth; the other, its
simple motion in its own epicycle. For these
mountains being, by reason of their height, more
eminent than all the rest of the parts of the earth,
do by both these motions drive the air from the
west eastwards. To which, though the diurnal
motion contribute but little, yet seeing I have
supposed that the simple motion of the earth, in its
own epicycle, makes two revolutions in the same
time in which the diurnal motion makes but one,
and that the semidiameter of the epicycle is double
to the semidiameter of the diurnal conversion, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>motion of every point of the earth in its own
epicycle will have its velocity quadruple to that of
the diurnal motion; so that by both these motions
together, the tops of those hills will sensibly be
moved against the air; and consequently a wind
will be felt. For whether the air strike the sentient,
or the sentient the air, the perception of
motion will be the same. But this wind, seeing it
is not caused by the ascent of vapours, must necessarily
be very constant.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is the effect of air pent in between the clouds.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.4'></a>4. When one cloud is already ascended into the
air, if another cloud ascend towards it, that part of
the air, which is intercepted between them both,
must of necessity be pressed out every way. Also
when both of them, whilst the one ascends and
the other either stays or descends, come to be
joined in such manner as that the ethereal substance
be shut within them on every side, it will
by this compression also go out by penetrating the
water. But in the meantime, the hard particles,
which are mingled with the air and are agitated,
as I have supposed, with simple motion, will not
pass through the water of the clouds, but be more
straitly compressed within their cavities. And
this I have demonstrated at the <a href='#art22.4'>4th</a> and <a href='#art22.5'>5th</a> articles
of chapter <span class='fss'>XXII</span>. Besides, seeing the globe of the
earth floateth in the air which is agitated by the
sun's motion, the parts of the air resisted by the
earth will spread themselves every way upon the
earth's superficies; as I have shown at the <a href='#art21.8'>8th article</a>
of chapter <span class='fss'>XXI</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>No change from soft to hard, but by motion.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.5'></a>5. We perceive a body to be hard, from this,
that, when touching it, we would thrust forwards
that part of the same which we touch, we cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>do it otherwise than by thrusting forwards the
whole body. We may indeed easily and sensibly
thrust forwards any particle of the air or water
which we touch, whilst yet the rest of its parts
remain to sense unmoved. But we cannot do so
to any part of a stone. Wherefore I define a <em>hard</em>
body to be that whereof no part can be sensibly
moved, unless the whole be moved. Whatsoever
therefore is soft or fluid, the same can never be
made hard but by such motion as makes many of
the parts together stop the motion of some one
part, by resisting the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What it the cause of cold near the poles.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.6'></a>6. Those things premised, I shall show a possible
cause why there is greater cold near the poles of
the earth, than further from them. The motion
of the sun between the tropics, driving the air
towards that part of the earth's superficies which
is perpendicularly under it, makes it spread itself
every way; and the velocity of this expansion of
the air grows greater and greater, as the superficies
of the earth comes to be more and more straitened,
that is to say, as the circles which are parallel to
the equator come to be less and less. Wherefore
this expansive motion of the air drives before it
the parts of the air, which are in its way, continually
towards the poles more and more strongly,
as its force comes to be more and more united,
that is to say, as the circles which are parallel to
the equator are less and less; that is, so much the
more, by how much they are nearer to the poles
of the earth. In those places, therefore, which are
nearer to the poles, there is greater cold than in
those which are more remote from them. Now this
expansion of the air upon the superficies of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>earth, from east to west, doth, by reason of the
sun's perpetual accession to the places which are
successively under it, make it cold at the time of
the sun's rising and setting; but as the sun comes
to be continually more and more perpendicular to
those cooled places, so by the heat, which is generated
by the supervening simple motion of the
sun, that cold is again remitted; and can never be
great, because the action by which it was generated
is not permanent. Wherefore I have rendered a
possible cause of cold in those places that are near
the poles, or where the obliquity of the sun is great.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of ice; and why the cold is more remiss in rainy than in clear weather. Why water doth not freeze in deep wells, as it doth near the superficies of the earth. Why ice is not so heavy as water; and why wine is not so easily frozen as water.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.7'></a>7. How water may be congealed by cold, may
be explained in this manner. <a id='fig30.1'></a>Let A (in <a href='#fig30.f1'>figure 1</a>)
represent the sun, and B the earth. A will therefore
be much greater than B. Let E F be in the
plane of the equinoctial; to which let G H, I K,
and L C be parallel. Lastly, let C and D be the
poles of the earth. The air, therefore, by its
action in those parallels, will rake the superficies
of the earth; and that with motion so much the
stronger, by how much the parallel circles towards
the poles grow less and less. From whence must
arise a wind, which will force together the uppermost
parts of the water, and withal raise them a
little, weakening their endeavour towards the
centre of the earth. And from their endeavour
towards the centre of the earth, joined with the
endeavour of the said wind, the uppermost parts
of the water will be pressed together and coagulated,
that is to say, the top of the water will be
skinned over and hardened. And so again, the
water next the top will be hardened in the same
manner, till at length the ice be thick. And this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>ice, being now compacted of little hard bodies,
must also contain many particles of air received
into it.</p>

<p class='c001'>As rivers and seas, so also in the same manner
may the clouds be frozen. For when, by the
ascending and descending of several clouds at the
same time, the air intercepted between them is by
compression forced out, it rakes, and by little and
little hardens them. And though those small drops,
which usually make clouds, be not yet united into
greater bodies, yet the same wind will be made;
and by it, as water is congealed into ice, so will
vapours in the same manner be congealed into
snow. From the same cause it is that ice may be
made by art, and that not far from the fire. For
it is done by the mingling of snow and salt
together, and by burying in it a small vessel full of
water. Now while the snow and salt, which have
in them a great deal of air, are melting, the air,
which is pressed out every way in wind, rakes the
sides of the vessel; and as the wind by its motion
rakes the vessel, so the vessel by the same motion
and action congeals the water within it.</p>

<p class='c001'>We find by experience, that cold is always more
remiss in places where it rains, or where the
weather is cloudy, things being alike in all other
respects, than where the air is clear. And this
agreeth very well with what I have said before.
For in clear weather, the course of the wind which,
as I said even now, rakes the superficies of the
earth, as it is free from all interruption, so also it
is very strong. But when small drops of water
are either rising or falling, that wind is repelled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>broken, and dissipated by them; and the less the
wind is, the less is the cold.</p>

<p class='c001'>We find also by experience, that in deep wells
the water freezeth not so much as it doth upon the
superficies of the earth. For the wind, by which
ice is made, entering into the earth by reason of
the laxity of its parts, more or less, loseth some of
its force, though not much. So that if the well be
not deep, it will freeze; whereas if it be so deep,
as that the wind which causeth cold cannot reach
it, it will not freeze.</p>

<p class='c001'>We find moreover by experience, that ice is
lighter than water. The cause whereof is manifest
from that which I have already shown, namely, that
air is received in and mingled with the particles of
the water whilst it is congealing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, wine is not so easily congealed as water,
because in wine there are particles, which, being
not fluid, are moved very swiftly, and by their
motion congelation is retarded. But if the cold
prevail against this motion, then the outermost
parts of the wine will be first frozen, and afterwards
the inner parts; whereof this is a sign, that
the wine which remains unfrozen in the midst will
be very strong.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Another cause of hardness from the fuller contact of atoms. Also how hard things are broken.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.8'></a>8. We have seen one way of making things hard,
namely, by congelation. Another way is thus.
Having already supposed that innumerable atoms,
some harder than others and that have several
simple motions of their own, are intermingled with
the ethereal substance; it follows necessarily from
hence, that by reason of the fermentation of the
whole air, of which I have spoken in chapter <span class='fss'>XXI</span>,
some of those atoms meeting with others will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>cleave together, by applying themselves to one
another in such manner as is agreeable to their
motions and mutual contacts; and, seeing there is
no vacuum, cannot be pulled asunder, but by
so much force as is sufficient to overcome their
hardness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now there are innumerable degrees of hardness.
As for example, there is a degree of it in water,
as is manifest from this, that upon a plane it may
be drawn any way at pleasure by one's finger.
There is a greater degree of it in clammy liquors,
which, when they are poured out, do in falling
downwards dispose themselves into one continued
thread; which thread, before it be broken, will by
little and little diminish its thickness, till at last it
be so small, as that it seems to break only in a
point; and in their separation the external parts
break first from one another, and then the more
internal parts successively one after another. In
wax there is yet a greater degree of hardness. For
when we would pull one part of it from another,
we first make the whole mass slenderer, before we
can pull it asunder. And how much the harder
anything is which we would break, so much the
more force we must apply to it. Wherefore, if we
go on to harder things, as ropes, wood, metals,
stones, &#38;c., reason prompteth us to believe that the
same, though not always sensibly, will necessarily
happen; and that even the hardest things are
broken asunder in the same manner, namely, by
solution of their continuity begun in the outermost
superficies, and proceeding successively to the
innermost parts. In like manner, when the parts
of bodies are to be separated, not by pulling them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>asunder, but by breaking them, the first separation
will necessarily be in the convex superficies of the
bowed part of the body, and afterwards in the
concave superficies. For in all bowing there is in
the convex superficies an endeavour in the parts to
go one from another, and in the concave superficies
to penetrate one another.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being well understood, a reason may be
given how two bodies, which are contiguous in one
common superficies, may by force be separated
without the introduction of vacuum; though
Lucretius thought otherwise, believing that such
separation was a strong establishment of vacuum.
For a marble pillar being made to hang by one of
its bases, if it be long enough, it will by its own
weight be broken asunder; and yet it will not
necessarily follow that there should be vacuum,
seeing the solution of its continuity may begin in
the circumference, and proceed successively to the
midst thereof.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A third cause of hardness, from heat.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.9'></a>9. Another cause of hardness in some things
may be in this manner. If a soft body consist of
many hard particles, which by the intermixture of
many other fluid particles cohere but loosely together,
those fluid parts, as hath been shown in
the <a href='#art21.11'>last article</a> of chapter <span class='fss'>XXI</span>, will be exhaled;
by which means each hard particle will apply itself
to the next to it according to a greater superficies,
and consequently they will cohere more closely to
one another, that is to say, the whole mass will be
made harder.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A fourth cause of hardness, from the motion of atoms enclosed in a narrow space.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.10'></a>10. Again, in some things hardness may be made
to a certain degree in this manner. When any
fluid substance hath in it certain very small bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>intermingled, which, being moved with simple motion
of their own, contribute like motion to the
parts of the fluid substance, and this be done in a
small enclosed space, as in the hollow of a little
sphere, or a very slender pipe, if the motion be
vehement and there be a great number of these
small enclosed bodies, two things will happen; the
one, that the fluid substance will have an endeavour
of dilating itself at once every way; the other,
that if those small bodies can nowhere get out,
then from their reflection it will follow, that the
motion of the parts of the enclosed fluid substance,
which was vehement before, will now be much
more vehement. Wherefore, if any one particle
of that fluid substance should be touched and
pressed by some external movent, it could not yield
but by the application of very sensible force.
Wherefore the fluid substance, which is enclosed
and so moved, hath some degree of hardness.
Now, greater and less degree of hardness depends
upon the quantity and velocity of those small
bodies, and upon the narrowness of the place both
together.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How hard things are softened.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.11'></a>11. Such things as are made hard by sudden
heat, namely such as are hardened by fire, are
commonly reduced to their former soft form by
maceration. For fire hardens by evaporation, and
therefore if the evaporated moisture be restored
again, the former nature and form is restored
together with it. And such things as are frozen
with cold, if the wind by which they were frozen
change into the opposite quarter, they will be unfrozen
again, unless they have gotten a habit of
new motion or endeavour by long continuance in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>that hardness. Nor is it enough to cause thawing,
that there be a cessation of the freezing wind; for
the taking away of the cause doth not destroy a
produced effect; but the thawing also must have
its proper cause, namely, a contrary wind, or at
least a wind opposite in some degree. And this
we find to be true by experience. For, if ice be
laid in a place so well enclosed that the motion of
the air cannot get to it, that ice will remain unchanged,
though the place be not sensibly cold.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Whence proceeds the spontaneous restitution of things bent.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.12'></a>12. Of hard bodies, some may manifestly be
bowed; others not, but are broken in the very
first moment of their bending. And of such
bodies as may manifestly be bended, some being
bent, do, as soon as ever they are set at liberty,
restore themselves to their former posture; others
remain still bent. Now if the cause of this restitution
be asked, I say, it may be in this manner,
namely, that the particles of the bended body,
whilst it is held bent, do nevertheless retain their
motion; and by this motion they restore it as soon
as the force is removed by which it was bent. For
when any thing is bent, as a plate of steel, and, as
soon as the force is removed, restores itself again, it
is evident that the cause of its restitution cannot be
referred to the ambient air; nor can it be referred
to the removal of the force by which it was bent;
for in things that are at rest the taking away of
impediments is not a sufficient cause of their future
motion; there being no other cause of motion, but
motion. The cause therefore of such restitution is
in the parts of the steel itself. Wherefore, whilst
it remains bent, there is in the parts, of which it
consisteth, some motion though invisible; that is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>say, some endeavour at least that way by which
the restitution is to be made; and therefore this
endeavour of all the parts together is the first
beginning of restitution; so that the impediment
being removed, that is to say, the force by which
it was held bent, it will be restored again. Now
the motion of the parts, by which this done, is
that which I called simple motion, or motion
returning into itself. When therefore in the bending
of a plate the ends are drawn together, there
is on one side a mutual compression of the parts;
which compression is one endeavour opposite to
another endeavour: and on the other side a divulsion
of the parts. The endeavour therefore of the
parts on one side tends to the restitution of the
plate from the middle towards the ends; and on
the other side, from the ends towards the middle.
Wherefore the impediment being taken away, this
endeavour, which is the beginning of restitution,
will restore the plate to its former posture. And
thus I have given a possible cause why some bodies,
when they are bent, restore themselves again;
which was to be done.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for stones, seeing they are made by the
accretion of many very hard particles within the
earth; which particles have no great coherence,
that is to say, touch one another in small latitude,
and consequently admit many particles of air; it
must needs be that, in bending of them, their
internal parts will not easily be compressed, by
reason of their hardness. And because their coherence
is not firm, as soon as the external hard
particles are disjoined, the ethereal parts will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>necessarily break out, and so the body will suddenly
be broken.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Diaphanous and opacous, what they are, and whence.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.13'></a>13. Those bodies are called <em>diaphanous</em>, upon
which, whilst the beams of a lucid body do work,
the action of every one of those beams is propagated
in them in such manner, as that they still
retain the same order amongst themselves, or the
inversion of that order; and therefore bodies,
which are perfectly diaphanous, are also perfectly
homogeneous. On the contrary, an <em>opacous</em> body
is that, which, by reason of its heterogeneous
nature, doth by innumerable reflections and refractions
in particles of different figures and unequal
hardness, weaken the beams that fall upon it before
they reach the eye. And of diaphanous bodies,
some are made such by nature from the beginning;
as the substance of the air, and of the water, and
perhaps also some parts of stones, unless these
also be water that has been long congealed. Others
are made so by the power of heat, which congregates
homogeneous bodies. But such, as are made
diaphanous in this manner, consist of parts which
were formerly diaphanous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of lightning and thunder.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.14'></a>14. In what manner clouds are made by the
motion of the sun, elevating the particles of water
from the sea and other moist places, hath been
explained in <a href='#ch26'>chapter <span class='fss'>XXVI</span></a>. Also how clouds come
to be frozen, hath been shown above at the <a href='#art28.7'>7th article</a>.
Now from this, that air may be enclosed
as it were in caverns, and pent together more and
more by the meeting of ascending and descending
clouds, may be deduced a possible cause of <em>thunder</em>
and <em>lightning</em>. For seeing the air consists of two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>parts, the one ethereal, which has no proper motion
of its own, as being a thing divisible into the
least parts; the other hard, namely, consisting of
many hard atoms, which have every one of them
a very swift simple motion of its own: whilst the
clouds by their meeting do more and more straiten
such cavities as they intercept, the ethereal parts
will penetrate and pass through their watery substance;
but the hard parts will in the meantime
be the more thrust together, and press one another;
and consequently, by reason of their vehement
motions, they will have an endeavour to rebound
from each other. Whensoever, therefore, the compression
is great enough, and the concave parts of
the clouds are, for the cause I have already given,
congealed into ice, the cloud will necessarily be
broken; and this breaking of the cloud produceth
the first clap of thunder. Afterwards the air,
which was pent in, having now broken through,
makes a concussion of the air without, and from
hence proceeds the roaring and murmur which
follows; and both the first clap and the murmur
that follows it make that noise which is called
<em>thunder</em>. Also, from the same air breaking through
the clouds and with concussion falling upon the
eye, proceeds that action upon our eye, which
causeth in us a perception of that light, which we
call <em>lightning</em>. Wherefore I have given a possible
cause of thunder and lightning.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Whence it proceeds that clouds can fall again, after they are once elevated and frozen.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.15'></a>15. But if the vapours, which are raised into
clouds, do run together again into water or be
congealed into ice, from whence is it, seeing both
ice and water are heavy, that they are sustained in
the air? Or rather, what may the cause be, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>being once elevated, they fall down again? For
there is no doubt but the same force which could
carry up that water, could also sustain it there.
Why therefore being once carried up, doth it fall
again? I say it proceeds from the same simple
motion of the sun, both that vapours are forced to
ascend, and that water gathered into clouds is
forced to descend. For in chapter <span class='fss'>XXI</span>, <a href='#art21.11'>article 11</a>,
I have shown how vapours are elevated;
and in the same chapter, <a href='#art21.5'>article 5</a>, I have also
shown how by the same motion homogeneous
bodies are congregated, and heterogeneous dissipated;
that is to say, how such things, as have a
like nature to that of the earth, are driven towards
the earth; that is to say, what is the cause of the
descent of heavy bodies. Now if the action of the
sun be hindered in the raising of vapours, and be
not at all hindered in the casting of them down, the
water will descend. But a cloud cannot hinder
the action of the sun in making things of an
earthly nature descend to the earth, though it may
hinder it in making vapours ascend. For the
lower part of a thick cloud is so covered by its
upper part, as that it cannot receive that action of
the sun by which vapours are carried up; because
vapours are raised by the perpetual fermentation
of the air, or by the separating of its smallest parts
from one another, which is much weaker when a
thick cloud is interposed, than when the sky is
clear. And therefore, whensoever a cloud is made
thick enough, the water, which would not descend
before, will then descend, unless it be kept up by
the agitation of the wind. Wherefore I have rendered
a possible cause, both why the clouds may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>be sustained in the air, and also why they may fall
down again to the earth; which was propounded
to be done.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How it could be that the moon was eclipsed, when she was not diametrically opposite to the sun.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.16'></a>16. Granting that the clouds may be frozen, it is
no wonder if the moon have been seen eclipsed at
such time as she hath been almost two degrees
above the horizon, the sun at the same time appearing
in the horizon; for such an eclipse was observed
by Mæstlin, at Tubingen, in the year 1590.
For it might happen that a frozen cloud was then
interposed between the sun and the eye of the
observer. And if it were so, the sun, which was
then almost two degrees below the horizon, might
appear to be in it, by reason of the passing of his
beams through the ice. And it is to be noted that
those, that attribute such refractions to the atmosphere,
cannot attribute to it so great a refraction
as this. Wherefore not the atmosphere, but either
water in a continued body, or else ice, must be the
cause of that refraction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>By what means many suns may appear at once.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.17'></a>17. Again, granting that there may be ice in the
clouds, it will be no longer a wonder that many
suns have sometimes appeared at once. For looking-glasses
may be so placed, as by reflections to
show the same object in many places. And may
not so many frozen clouds serve for so many looking-glasses?
And may they not be fitly disposed for
that purpose? Besides, the number of appearances
may be increased by refractions also; and therefore
it would be a greater wonder to me, if such
phenomena as these should never happen.</p>

<p class='c001'>And were it not for that one phenomenon of the
new star which was seen in Cassiopea, I should
think comets were made in the same manner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>namely, by vapours drawn not only from the earth
but from the rest of the planets also, and congealed
into one continued body. For I could very well
from hence give a reason both of their hair, and of
their motions. But seeing that star remained
sixteen whole months in the same place amongst
the fixed stars, I cannot believe the matter of it
was ice. Wherefore I leave to others the disquisition
of the cause of comets; concerning which
nothing that hath hitherto been published, besides
the bare histories of them, is worth considering.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the heads of rivers.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art28.18'></a>18. The heads of rivers may be deduced from
rain-water, or from melted snows, very easily; but
from other causes, very hardly, or not at all. For
both rain-water and melted snows run down the
descents of mountains; and if they descend only
by the outward superficies, the showers or snows
themselves may be accounted the springs or fountains;
but if they enter the earth and descend
within it, then, wheresoever they break out, there
are their springs. And as these springs make
small streams, so, many small streams running
together make rivers. Now, there was never any
spring found, but where the water which flowed to
it, was either further, or at least as far from the
centre of the earth, as the spring itself. And
whereas it has been objected by a great philosopher,
that in the top of Mount Cenis, which parts
Savoy from Piedmont, there springs a river which
runs down by Susa; it is not true. For there are
above that river, for two miles length, very high
hills on both sides, which are almost perpetually
covered with snow; from which innumerable little
streams running down do manifestly supply that
river with water sufficient for its magnitude.</p>

<div  class='c009'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The definition of sound, and the distinction of sounds.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.1'></a>1. <span class='sc'>Sound</span> <em>is sense generated by the action of the
medium, when its motion reacheth the ear and the
rest of the organs of sense</em>. Now, the motion of
the medium is not the sound itself, but the cause
of it. For the phantasm which is made in us, that
is to say, the reaction of the organ, is properly that
which we call <em>sound</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The principal distinctions of sounds are these;
first, that one sound is stronger, another weaker.
Secondly, that one is more grave, another more
acute. Thirdly, that one is clear, another hoarse.
Fourthly, that one is primary, another derivative.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>Fifthly, that one is uniform, another not. Sixthly,
that one is more durable, another less durable. Of
all which distinctions the members may be subdistinguished
into parts distinguishable almost infinitely.
For the variety of sounds seems to be not
much less than that of colours.</p>

<p class='c001'>As vision, so hearing is generated by the motion
of the medium, but not in the same manner. For
sight is from pressure, that is, from an endeavour;
in which there is no perceptible progression of any
of the parts of the medium; but one part urging
or thrusting on another propagateth that action
successively to any distance whatsoever; whereas
the motion of the medium, by which sound is made,
is a stroke. For when we hear, the drum of the
ear, which is the first organ of hearing, is stricken;
and the drum being stricken, the <span lang="la"><i>pia mater</i></span> is also
shaken, and with it the arteries which are inserted
into it; by which the action being propagated to
the heart itself, by the reaction of the heart a phantasm
is made which we call sound; and because
the reaction tendeth outwards, we think it is
without.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of the degrees of sounds.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.2'></a>2. And seeing the effects produced by motion
are greater or less, not only when the velocity is
greater or less, but also when the body hath greater
or less magnitude though the velocity be the same;
a sound may be greater or less both these ways.
And because neither the greatest nor the least
magnitude or velocity can be given, it may happen
that either the motion may be of so small velocity,
or the body itself of so small magnitude, as to produce
no sound at all; or either of them may be so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>great, as to take away the faculty of sense by
hurting the organ.</p>

<p class='c001'>From hence may be deduced possible causes of
the strength and weakness of sounds in the following
phenomena.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first whereof is this, that if a man speak
through a trunk which hath one end applied to the
mouth of the speaker, and the other to the ear of
the hearer, the sound will come stronger than it
would do through the open air. And the cause,
not only the possible, but the certain and manifest
cause is this, that the air which is moved by the
first breath and carried forwards in the trunk, is
not diffused as it would be in the open air, and is
consequently brought to the ear almost with the
same velocity with which it was first breathed out.
Whereas, in the open air, the first motion diffuseth
itself every way into circles, such as are made by
the throwing of a stone into a standing water,
where the velocity grows less and less as the undulation
proceeds further and further from the beginning
of its motion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second is this, that if the trunk be short,
and the end which is applied to the mouth be wider
than that which is applied to the ear, thus also the
sound will be stronger than if it were made in the
open air. And the cause is the same, namely, that
by how much the wider end of the trunk is less
distant from the beginning of the sound, by so
much the less is the diffusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third, that it is easier for one, that is within
a chamber, to hear what is spoken without, than
for him, that stands without, to hear what is spoken
within. For the windows and other inlets of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>moved air are as the wide end of the trunk. And
for this reason some creatures seem to hear the
better, because nature has bestowed upon them
wide and capacious ears.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fourth is this, that though he, which standeth
upon the sea-shore, cannot hear the collision of
the two nearest waves, yet nevertheless he hears
the roaring of the whole sea. And the cause seems
to be this, that though the several collisions move
the organ, yet they are not severally great enough
to cause sense; whereas nothing hinders but that
all of them together may make sound.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The difference between sounds acute and grave.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.3'></a>3. That bodies when they are stricken do yield
some a more grave, others a more acute sound, the
cause may consist in the difference of the times in
which the parts stricken and forced out of their
places return to the same places again. For in
some bodies, the restitution of the moved parts is
quick, in others slow. And this also may be the
cause, why the parts of the organ, which are moved
by the medium, return to their rest again, sometimes
sooner, sometimes later. Now, by how much
the vibrations or the reciprocal motions of the
parts are more frequent, by so much doth the
whole sound made at the same time by one stroke
consist of more, and consequently of smaller parts.
For what is acute in sound, the same is subtle in
matter; and both of them, namely acute sound
and subtle matter, consist of very small parts, that
of time, and this of the matter itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third distinction of sounds cannot be conceived
clearly enough by the names I have used of
<em>clear</em> and <em>hoarse</em>, nor by any other that I know;
and therefore it is needful to explain them by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>examples. When I say hoarse, I understand whispering
and hissing, and whatsoever is like to these,
by what appellation soever it be expressed. And
sounds of this kind seem to be made by the force
of some strong wind, raking rather than striking
such hard bodies as it falls upon. On the contrary,
when I use the word clear, I do not understand
such a sound as may be easily and distinctly
heard; for so whispers would be clear; but such
as is made by somewhat that is broken, and such
as is clamour, tinkling, the sound of a trumpet, &#38;c.
and to express it significantly in one word, noise.
And seeing no sound is made but by the concourse
of two bodies at the least, by which concourse it is
necessary that there be as well reaction as action,
that is to say, one motion opposite to another; it
follows that according as the proportion between
those two opposite motions is diversified, so the
sounds which are made will be different from one
another. And whensoever the proportion between
them is so great, as that the motion of one of the
bodies be insensible if compared with the motion
of the other, then the sound will not be of the same
kind; as when the wind falls very obliquely upon
a hard body, or when a hard body is carried swiftly
through the air; for then there is made that sound
which I call a hoarse sound, in Greek συριγμος.
Therefore the breath blown with violence from the
mouth makes a hissing, because in going out it
rakes the superficies of the lips, whose reaction
against the force of the breath is not sensible.
And this is the cause why the winds have that
hoarse sound. Also if two bodies, how hard soever,
be rubbed together with no great pressure, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>make a hoarse sound. And this hoarse sound,
when it is made, as I have said, by the air raking
the superficies of a hard body, seemeth to be
nothing but the dividing of the air into innumerable
and very small files. For the asperity of the
superficies doth, by the eminences of its innumerable
parts, divide or cut in pieces the air that slides
upon it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The difference between clear &#38; hoarse sounds, whence.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.4'></a>4. <em>Noise</em>, or that which I call clear sound, is
made two ways; one, by two hoarse sounds made
by opposite motions; the other, by collision, or by
the sudden pulling asunder of two bodies, whereby
their small particles are put into commotion, or
being already in commotion suddenly restore
themselves again; which motion, making impression
upon the medium, is propagated to the organ
of hearing. And seeing there is in this collision
or divulsion an endeavour in the particles of one
body, opposite to the endeavour of the particles of
the other body, there will also be made in the
organ of hearing a like opposition of endeavours,
that is to say, of motions; and consequently the
sound arising from thence will be made by two
opposite motions, that is to say, by two opposite
hoarse sounds in one and the same part of the
organ. For, as I have already said, a hoarse sound
supposeth the sensible motion of but one of the
bodies. And this opposition of motions in the
organ is the cause why two bodies make a noise,
when they are either suddenly stricken against one
another, or suddenly broken asunder.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The sound of thunder and of a gun, whence it proceeds.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.5'></a>5. This being granted, and seeing withal that
thunder is made by the vehement eruption of the
air out of the cavities of congealed clouds, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>cause of the great noise or clap may be the sudden
breaking asunder of the ice. For in this action it
is necessary that there be not only a great concussion
of the small particles of the broken parts, but
also that this concussion, by being communicated
to the air, be carried to the organ of hearing, and
make impression upon it. And then, from the
first reaction of the organ proceeds that first and
greatest sound, which is made by the collision of
the parts whilst they restore themselves. And
seeing there is in all concussion a reciprocation
of motion forwards and backwards in the parts
stricken; for opposite motions cannot extinguish
one another in an instant, as I have shown in the
<a href='#art8.11'>11th article</a> of chapter <span class='fss'>VIII</span>; it follows necessarily
that the sound will both continue, and grow weaker
and weaker, till at last the action of the reciprocating
air grow so weak, as to be imperceptible.
Wherefore a possible cause is given both of the
first fierce noise of the thunder, and also of the
murmur that follows it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cause of the great sound from a discharged
piece of ordnance is like that of a clap of thunder.
For the gunpowder being fired doth, in its endeavour
to go out, attempt every way the sides of
the metal in such manner, as that it enlargeth the
circumference all along, and withal shorteneth the
axis; so that whilst the piece of ordnance is in
discharging, it is made both wider and shorter
than it was before; and therefore also presently
after it is discharged its wideness will be diminished,
and its length increased again by the restitution
of all the particles of the matter, of which it
consisteth, to their former position. And this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>done with such motions of the parts, as are not
only very vehement, but also opposite to one
another; which motions, being communicated to
the air, make impression upon the organ, and by
the reaction of the organ create a sound, which
lasteth for some time; as I have already shown in
this article.</p>

<p class='c001'>I note by the way, as not belonging to this
place, that the possible cause why a gun recoils
when it is shot off, may be this; that being first
swollen by the force of the fire, and afterwards
restoring itself, from this restitution there proceeds
an endeavour from all the sides towards the
cavity; and consequently this endeavour is in
those parts which are next the breech; which
being not hollow, but solid, the effect of the restitution
is by it hindered and diverted into the
length; and by this means both the breech and
the whole gun is thrust backwards; and the more
forcibly by how much the force is greater, by
which the part next the breech is restored to its
former posture, that is to say, by how much the
thinner is that part. The cause, therefore, why
guns recoil, some more some less, is the difference
of their thickness towards the breech; and the
greater that thickness is, the less they recoil; and
contrarily.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Whence it is that pipes, by blowing into them, have a clear sound.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.6'></a>6. Also the cause why the sound of a pipe, which
is made by blowing into it, is nevertheless clear, is
the same with that of the sound which is made by
collision. For if the breath, when it is blown into
a pipe, do only rake its concave superficies, or fall
upon it with a very sharp angle of incidence, the
sound will not be clear, but hoarse. But if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>angle be great enough, the percussion, which is
made against one of the hollow sides, will be reverberated
to the opposite side; and so successive
repercussions will be made from side to side, till at
last the whole concave superficies of the pipe be
put into motion; which motion will be reciprocated,
as it is in collision; and this reciprocation
being propagated to the organ, from the reaction
of the organ will arise a clear sound, such as is
made by collision, or by breaking asunder of hard
bodies.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the same manner it is with the sound of a
man's voice. For when the breath passeth out
without interruption, and doth but lightly touch
the cavities through which it is sent, the sound it
maketh is a hoarse sound. But if in going out it
strike strongly upon the <em>larynx</em>, then a clear
sound is made, as in a pipe. And the same
breath, as it comes in divers manners to the palate,
the tongue, the lips, the teeth, and other organs of
speech, so the sounds into which it is articulated
become different from one another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of reflected sound.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.7'></a>7. I call that <em>primary sound</em>, which is generated
by motion from the sounding body to the organ in
a strait line without reflection; and I call that
<em>reflected sound</em>, which is generated by one or more
reflections, being the same with that we call <em>echo</em>,
and is iterated as often as there are reflections
made from the object to the ear. And these reflections
are made by hills, walls, and other resisting
bodies, so placed as that they make more or
fewer reflections of the motion, according as they
are themselves more or fewer in number; and
they make them more or less frequently, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>as they are more or less distant from one another.
Now the cause of both these things is to be sought
for in the situation of the reflecting bodies, as is
usually done in sight. For the laws of reflection
are the same in both, namely, that the angles of
incidence and reflection be equal to one another.
If, therefore, in a hollow elliptic body, whose inside
is well polished, or in two right parabolical
solids, which are joined together by one common
base, there be placed a sounding body in one of
the burning points, and the ear in the other, there
will be heard a sound by many degrees greater
than in the open air; and both this, and the burning
of such combustible things, as being put in
the same places are set on fire by the sun-beams,
are effects of one and the same cause. But, as
when the visible object is placed in one of the
burning points, it is not distinctly seen in the other,
because every part of the object being seen in
every line, which is reflected from the concave
superficies to the eye, makes a confusion in the
sight; so neither is sound heard articulately and
distinctly when it comes to the ear in all those
reflected lines. And this may be the reason why
in churches which have arched roofs, though they
be neither elliptical nor parabolical, yet because
their figure is not much different from these, the
voice from the pulpit will not be heard so articulately
as it would be, if there were no vaulting at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>From whence it is that sound is uniform and lasting.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.8'></a>8. Concerning the <em>uniformity</em> and <em>duration</em> of
sounds, both which have one common cause, we
may observe, that such bodies as being stricken
yield an unequal or harsh sound, are very heterogeneous,
that is to say, they consist of parts which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>are very unlike both in figure and hardness, such
as are wood, stones, and others not a few. When
these are stricken, there follows a concussion of
their internal particles, and a restitution of them
again. But they are neither moved alike, nor
have they the same action upon one another;
some of them recoiling from the stroke, whilst
others which have already finished their recoilings
are now returning; by which means they hinder
and stop one another. And from hence it is that
their motions are not only unequal and harsh, but
also that their reciprocations come to be quickly
extinguished. Whensoever, therefore, this motion
is propagated to the ear, the sound it makes is
unequal and of small duration. On the contrary,
if a body that is stricken be not only sufficiently
hard, but have also the particles of which it consisteth
like to one another both in hardness and
figure, such as are the particles of glass and metals,
which being first melted do afterwards settle and
harden; the sound it yieldeth will, because the
motions of its parts and their reciprocations are
like and uniform, be uniform and pleasant, and be
more or less lasting, according as the body stricken
hath greater or less magnitude. The possible
cause, therefore, of sounds uniform and harsh, and
of their longer or shorter duration, may be one
and the same likeness and unlikeness of the internal
parts of the sounding body, in respect both of
their figure and hardness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides, if two plane bodies of the same matter
and of equal thickness, do both yield an uniform
sound, the sound of that body, which hath the
greatest extent of length, will be the longest heard.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>For the motion, which in both of them hath its
beginning from the point of percussion, is to be
propagated in the greater body through a greater
space, and consequently that propagation will require
more time; and therefore also the parts
which are moved, will require more time for their
return. Wherefore all the reciprocations cannot
be finished but in longer time; and being carried
to the ear, will make the sound last the longer.
And from hence it is manifest, that of hard bodies
which yield an uniform sound, the sound lasteth
longer which comes from those that are round and
hollow, than from those that are plane, if they be
like in all other respects. For in circular lines
the action, which begins at any point, hath not
from the figure any end of its propagation, because
the line in which it is propagated returns again to
its beginning; so that the figure hinders not but
that the motion may have infinite progression.
Whereas in a plane, every line hath its magnitude
finite, beyond which the action cannot proceed.
If, therefore, the matter be the same, the motion
of the parts of that body whose figure is round
and hollow, will last longer than of that which is
plane.</p>

<p class='c001'>Also, if a string which is stretched be fastened
at both ends to a hollow body, and be stricken, the
sound will last longer than if it were not so fastened;
because the trembling or reciprocation
which it receives from the stroke, is by reason of
the connection communicated to the hollow body;
and this trembling, if the hollow body be great, will
last the longer by reason of that greatness. Wherefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>also, for the reason above mentioned, the
sound will last the longer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How sound may be helped and hindered by the wind.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.9'></a>9. In hearing it happens, otherwise than in
seeing, that the action of the medium is made
stronger by the wind when it blows the same
way, and weaker when it blows the contrary way.
The cause whereof cannot proceed from anything
but the different generation of sound and light.
For in the generation of light, none of the parts
of the medium between the object and the eye are
moved from their own places to other places sensibly
distant; but the action is propagated in
spaces imperceptible; so that no contrary wind
can diminish, nor favourable wind encrease the
light, unless it be so strong as to remove the
object further off or bring it nearer to the eye.
For the wind, that is to say the air moved, doth
not by its interposition between the object and the
eye work otherwise than it would do, if it were
still and calm. For, where the pressure is perpetual,
one part of the air is no sooner carried away, but
another, by succeeding it, receives the same impression,
which the part carried away had received before.
But in the generation of sound, the first collision
or breaking asunder beateth away and driveth out
of its place the nearest part of the air, and that to
a considerable distance, and with considerable
velocity; and as the circles grow by their remoteness
wider and wider, so the air being more and
more dissipated, hath also its motion more and
more weakened. Whensoever therefore the air is
so stricken as to cause sound, if the wind fall upon
it, it will move it all nearer to the ear, if it blow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>that way, and further from it if it blow the contrary
way; so that according as it blows from or
towards the object, so the sound which is heard
will seem to come from a nearer or remoter place;
and the reaction, by reason of the unequal distances,
be strengthened or debilitated.</p>

<p class='c001'>From hence may be understood the reason why
the voice of such as are said to speak in their bellies,
though it be uttered near hand, is nevertheless
heard, by those that suspect nothing, as if it
were a great way off. For having no former thought
of any determined place from which the voice
should proceed, and judging according to the
greatness, if it be weak they think it a great way
off, if strong near. These ventriloqui, therefore,
by forming their voice, not as others by the emission
of their breath, but by drawing it inwards,
do make the same appear small and weak; which
weakness of the voice deceives those, that neither
suspect the artifice nor observe the endeavour
which they use in speaking; and so, instead of
thinking it weak, they think it far off.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Not only air, but other bodies, how hard soever they be, convey sound.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.10'></a>10. As for the medium, which conveys sound,
it is not air only. For water, or any other body
how hard soever, may be that medium. For the
motion may be propagated perpetually in any hard
continuous body; but by reason of the difficulty,
with which the parts of hard bodies are moved, the
motion in going out of hard matter makes but a
weak impression upon the air. Nevertheless, if one
end of a very long and hard beam be stricken, and
the ear be applied at the same time to the other end,
so that, when the action goeth out of the beam, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>air, which it striketh, may immediately be received
by the ear, and be carried to the tympanum, the
sound will be considerably strong.</p>

<p class='c001'>In like manner, if in the night, when all other
noise which may hinder sound ceaseth, a man lay
his ear to the ground, he will hear the sound of
the steps of passengers, though at a great distance;
because the motion, which by their treading they
communicate to the earth, is propagated to the ear
by the uppermost parts of the earth which receiveth
it from their feet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The causes of grave and acute sounds, and of concent.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.11'></a>11. I have shown above, that the difference between
grave and acute sounds consisteth in this,
that by how much the shorter the time is, in which
the reciprocations of the parts of a body stricken
are made, by so much the more acute will be the
sound. Now by how much a body of the same
bigness is either more heavy or less stretched, by
so much the longer will the reciprocations last;
and therefore heavier and less stretched bodies,
if they be like in all other respects, will yield a
graver sound than such as be lighter and more
stretched.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the concent of sounds, it is to be considered
that the reciprocation or vibration of the
air, by which sound is made, after it hath reached
the drum of the ear, imprinteth a like vibration
upon the air that is inclosed within it; by which
means the sides of the drum within are stricken
alternately. Now the concent of two sounds
consists in this, that the tympanum receives its
sounding stroke from both the sounding bodies in
equal and equally frequent spaces of time; so that
when two strings make their vibrations in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>times, the concent they produce is the most exquisite
of all other. For the sides of the tympanum,
that is to say of the organ of hearing, will be
stricken by both those vibrations together at once,
on one side or other. For example, if the two
equal strings A B and C D be stricken together, and
the latitudes of their vibrations E F and G H be
also equal, and the points E, G, F and H be in the
concave superficies of the tympanum, so that it
receive strokes from both the strings together in E
and G, and again together in F and H, the sound,
<span class='sni diagramnoline'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A————B<br>C————D<br>  G   E<br>   |   |<br>   |   | K<br>   |   | I<br>   |   | L<br>   |   |<br>  H   F<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which is made by the vibrations
of each string, will be so like,
that it may be taken for the
same sound, and is called <em>unison</em>;
which is the greatest concord.
Again, the string A B
retaining still its former vibration
E F, let the string C D be
stretched till its vibration have
double the swiftness it had before,
and let E F be divided equally in I. In what
time therefore the string C D makes one part of
its vibration from G to H, in the same time the
string A B will make one part of its vibration from
E to I; and in what time the string C D hath made
the other part of its vibration back from H to G,
in the same time another part of the vibration of
the string A B will be made from I to F. But the
points F and G are both in the sides of the organ,
and therefore they will strike the organ both together,
not at every stroke, but at every other
stroke. And this is the nearest concord to unison,
and makes that sound which is called an <em>eighth</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>Again, the vibration of the string A B remaining
still the same it was, let C D be stretched till its
vibration be swifter than that of the string A B in
the proportion of 3 to 2, and let E F be divided
into three equal parts in K and L. In what time
therefore the string C D makes one third part of
its vibration, which third part is from G to H, the
string A B will make one third part of its vibration,
that is to say, two-thirds of E F, namely, E L.
And in what time the string C D makes another
third part of its vibration, namely H G, the string
A B will make another third part of its vibration,
namely from L to F, and back again from F to L.
Lastly, whilst the string C D makes the last third
part of its vibration, that is from G to H, the
string A B will make the last third part of its
vibration from L to E. But the points E and H
are both in the sides of the organ. Wherefore, at
every third time, the organ will be stricken by the
vibration of both the strings together, and make
that concord which is called a <em>fifth</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Phenomena of smelling.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.12'></a>12. For the finding out the cause of <em>smells</em>, I
shall make use of the evidence of these following
phenomena. First, that smelling is hindered by
cold, and helped by heat. Secondly, that when
the wind bloweth from the object, the smell is the
stronger; and, contrarily, when it bloweth from
the sentient towards the object, the weaker; both
which phenomena are, by experience, manifestly
found to be true in dogs, which follow the track
of beasts by the scent. Thirdly, that such bodies,
as are less pervious to the fluid medium, yield less
smell than such as are more pervious; as may be
seen in stones and metals, which, compared with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>plants and living creatures, and their parts, fruits
and excretions, have very little or no smell at all.
Fourthly, that such bodies, as are of their own
nature odorous, become yet more odorous when
they are bruised. Fifthly, that when the breath
is stopped, at least in men, nothing can be smelt.
Sixthly, that the sense of smelling is also taken
away by the stopping of the nostrils, though the
mouth be left open.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first organ and the generation of smelling.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.13'></a>13. By the fifth and sixth phenomenon it is
manifest, that the first and immediate organ of
smelling is the innermost cuticle of the nostrils, and
that part of it, which is below the passage common
to the nostrils and the palate. For when we draw
breath by the nostrils we draw it into the lungs.
That breath, therefore, which conveys smells is in
the way which passeth to the lungs, that is to say,
in that part of the nostrils which is below the passage
through which the breath goeth. For, nothing
is smelt, neither beyond the passage of the breath
within, nor at all without the nostrils.</p>

<p class='c001'>And seeing that from different smells there must
necessarily proceed some mutation in the organ,
and all mutation is motion; it is therefore also necessary
that, in smelling, the parts of the organ,
that is to say of that internal cuticle and the
nerves that are inserted into it, must be diversely
moved by different smells. And seeing also, that
it hath been demonstrated, that nothing can be
moved but by a body that is already moved and
contiguous; and that there is no other body contiguous
to the internal membrane of the nostrils
but breath, that is to say attracted air, and such
little solid invisible bodies, if there be any such, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>are intermingled with the air; it follows necessarily,
that the cause of smelling is either the
motion of that pure air or ethereal substance, or
the motion of those small bodies. But this motion
is an effect proceeding from the object of smell,
and, therefore, either the whole object itself or its
several parts must necessarily be moved. Now,
we know that odorous bodies make odour, though
their whole bulk be not moved. Wherefore the
cause of odour is the motion of the invisible parts
of the odorous body. And these invisible parts do
either go out of the object, or else, retaining their
former situation with the rest of the parts, are
moved together with them, that is to say, they have
simple and invisible motion. They that say, there
goes something out of the odorous body, call it
an effluvium; which effluvium is either of the
ethereal substance, or of the small bodies that are
intermingled with it. But, that all variety of
odours should proceed from the effluvia of those
small bodies that are intermingled with the ethereal
substance, is altogether incredible, for these
considerations; first, that certain unguents, though
very little in quantity, do nevertheless send forth
very strong odours, not only to a great distance of
place, but also for a great continuance of time, and
are to be smelt in every point both of that place
and time; so that the parts issued out are sufficient
to fill ten thousand times more space, than the
whole odorous body is able to fill; which is impossible.
Secondly, that whether that issuing out be
with strait or with crooked motion, if the same
quantity should flow from any other odorous body
with the same motion, it would follow that all
odorous bodies would yield the same smell. Thirdly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>that seeing those effluvia have great velocity of
motion (as is manifest from this, that noisome
odours proceeding from caverns are presently
smelt at a great distance) it would follow, that, by
reason there is nothing to hinder the passage of
those effluvia to the organ, such motion alone
were sufficient to cause smelling; which is not so;
for we cannot smell at all, unless we draw in our
breath through our nostrils. Smelling, therefore,
is not caused by the effluvium of atoms; nor,
for the same reason, is it caused by the effluvium
of ethereal substance; for so also we should smell
without the drawing in of our breath. Besides,
the ethereal substance being the same in all odorous
bodies, they would always affect the organ in
the same manner; and, consequently, the odours of
all things would be alike.</p>

<p class='c001'>It remains, therefore, that the cause of smelling
must consist in the simple motion of the parts of
odorous bodies without any efflux or diminution
of their whole substance. And by this motion
there is propagated to the organ, by the intermediate
air, the like motion, but not strong enough
to excite sense of itself without the attraction of
air by respiration. And this is a possible cause of
smelling.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How smelling is helped by heat and by wind.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.14'></a>14. The cause why smelling is hindered by cold
and helped by heat may be this; that heat, as hath
been shown in chapter <span class='fss'>XXI</span>, generateth simple
motion; and therefore also, wheresoever it is
already, there it will increase it; and the cause of
smelling being increased, the smell itself will also
be increased. As for the cause why the wind
blowing from the object makes the smell the
stronger, it is all one with that for which the attraction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>of air in respiration doth the same. For,
he that draws in the air next to him, draws with it
by succession that air in which is the object.
Now, this motion of the air is wind, and, when
another wind bloweth from the object, will be increased
by it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Why such bodies are least smelt, which have the least intermixture of air in them.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.15'></a>15. That bodies which contain the least quantity
of air, as stones and metals, yield less smell
than plants and living creatures; the cause may
be, that the motion, which causeth smelling, is a
motion of the fluid parts only; which parts, if
they have any motion from the hard parts in which
they are contained, they communicate the same to
the open air, by which it is propagated to the
organ. Where, therefore, there are no fluid parts
as in metals, or where the fluid parts receive no
motion from the hard parts, as in stones, which
are made hard by accretion, there can be no smell.
And therefore also the water, whose parts have
little or no motion, yieldeth no smell. But, if the
same water, by seeds and the heat of the sun, be
together with particles of earth raised into a plant,
and be afterwards pressed out again, it will be
odorous, as wine from the vine. And as water
passing through plants is by the motion of the
parts of those plants made an odorous liquor; so
also of air, passing through the same plants whilst
they are growing, are made odorous airs. And
thus also it is with the juices and spirits, which are
bred in living creatures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Why odorous things become more odorous, when bruised.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.16'></a>16. That odorous bodies may be made more
odorous by contrition proceeds from this, that
being broken into many parts, which are all odorous,
the air, which by respiration is drawn from
the object towards the organ, doth in its passage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>touch upon all those parts, and receive their motion.
Now, the air toucheth the superficies only; and a
body having less superficies whilst it is whole, than
all its parts together have after it is reduced to
powder, it follows that the same odorous body
yieldeth less smell whilst it is whole, than it will do
after it is broken into smaller parts. And thus
much of smells.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first organ of tasting; and why some savours cause nauseousness.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.17'></a>17. The taste follows; whose generation hath
this difference from that of the sight, hearing, and
smelling, that by these we have sense of remote
objects; whereas, we taste nothing but what is
contiguous, and doth immediately touch either the
tongue or palate, or both. From whence it is evident,
that the cuticles of the tongue and palate,
and the nerves inserted into them are the first
organ of taste; and (because from the concussion
of the parts of these, there followeth necessarily a
concussion of the <span lang="la"><i>pia mater</i></span>) that the action communicated
to these is propagated to the brain, and
from thence to the farthest organ, namely, the
heart, in whose reaction consisteth the nature of
sense.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, that savours, as well as odours, do not
only move the brain but the stomach also, as is
manifest by the loathings that are caused by them
both; they, that consider the organ of both these
senses, will not wonder at all; seeing the tongue,
the palate and the nostrils, have one and the same
continued cuticle, derived from the <span lang="la"><i>dura mater</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>And that effluvia have nothing to do in the
sense of tasting, is manifest from this, that there
is no taste where the organ and the object are not
contiguous.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>By what variety of motions the different kinds
of tastes, which are innumerable, may be distinguished,
I know not. I might with others derive
them from the divers figures of those atoms, of
which whatsoever may be tasted consisteth; or
from the diverse motions which I might, by way of
supposition, attribute to those atoms; conjecturing,
not without some likelihood of truth, that such things
as taste sweet have their particles moved with slow
circular motion, and their figures spherical; which
makes them smooth and pleasing to the organ;
that bitter things have circular motion, but vehement,
and their figures full of angles, by which
they trouble the organ; and that sour things have
strait and reciprocal motion, and their figures long
and small, so that they cut and wound the organ.
And in like manner I might assign for the causes
of other tastes such several motions and figures of
atoms, as might in probability seem to be the true
causes. But this would be to revolt from philosophy
to divination.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The first organ of feeling; and how we came to the knowledge of such objects as are common to the touch and to other senses.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art29.18'></a>18. By the <em>touch</em>, we feel what bodies are cold
or hot, though they be distant from us. Others,
as hard, soft, rough, and smooth, we cannot feel
unless they be contiguous. The organ of touch is
every one of those membranes, which being continued
from the <span lang="la"><i>pia mater</i></span> are so diffused throughout
the whole body, as that no part of it can be
pressed, but the <span lang="la"><i>pia mater</i></span> is pressed together with
it. Whatsoever therefore presseth it, is felt as
hard or soft, that is to say, as more or less hard.
And as for the sense of rough, it is nothing else
but innumerable perceptions of hard and hard
succeeding one another by short intervals both of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>time and place. For we take notice of rough and
smooth, as also of magnitude and figure, not only
by the touch, but also by memory. For though
some things are touched in one point, yet rough
and smooth, like quantity and figure, are not perceived
but by the flux of a point, that is to say,
we have no sense of them without time; and we
can have no sense of time without memory.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A thick body doth not contain more matter, unless also more place, than a thin.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.1'></a>1. In chapter <span class='fss'>XXI</span> I have defined thick and thin,
as that place required, so, as that by thick was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>signified a more resisting body, and by thin, a body
less resisting; following the custom of those that
have before me discoursed of refraction. Now if
we consider the true and vulgar signification of
those words, we shall find them to be names collective,
that is to say, names of multitude; as <em>thick</em>
to be that, which takes up more parts of a space
given, and <em>thin</em> that, which contains fewer parts of
the same magnitude in the same space, or in a
space equal to it. Thick therefore is the same
with frequent, as a thick troop; and thin the same
with unfrequent, as a thin rank, thin of houses;
not that there is more matter in one place than in
another equal place, but a greater quantity of some
named body. For there is not less matter or body,
indefinitely taken, in a desert, than there is in a
city; but fewer houses, or fewer men. Nor is
there in a thick rank a greater quantity of body,
but a greater number of soldiers, than in a thin.
Wherefore the multitude and paucity of the parts
contained within the same space do constitute
density and rarity, whether those parts be separated
by vacuum or by air. But the consideration
of this is not of any great moment in philosophy;
and therefore I let it alone, and pass on to the
search of the causes of <em>gravity</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>That the descent of heavy bodies proceeds not from their own appetite, but from some power of the earth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.2'></a>2. Now we call those bodies <em>heavy</em>, which,
unless they be hindered by some force, are carried
towards the centre of the earth, and that by their
own accord, for aught we can by sense perceive to
the contrary. Some philosophers therefore have
been of opinion, that the descent of heavy bodies
proceeded from some internal appetite, by which,
when they were cast upwards, they descended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>again, as moved by themselves, to such place as
was agreeable to their nature. Others thought
they were attracted by the earth. To the former
I cannot assent, because I think I have already
clearly enough demonstrated that there can be no
beginning of motion, but from an external and
moved body; and consequently, that whatsoever
hath motion or endeavour towards any place, will
always move or endeavour towards that same place,
unless it be hindered by the reaction of some
external body. Heavy bodies, therefore, being
once cast upwards, cannot be cast down again
but by external motion. Besides, seeing inanimate
bodies have no appetite at all, it is ridiculous to
think that by their own innate appetite they should,
to preserve themselves, not understanding what
preserves them, forsake the place they are in, and
transfer themselves to another place; whereas
man, who hath both appetite and understanding,
cannot, for the preservation of his own life, raise
himself by leaping above three or four feet from
the ground. Lastly, to attribute to created bodies
the power to move themselves, what is it else than
to say that there be creatures which have no
dependance upon the Creator? To the latter, who
attribute the descent of heavy bodies to the attraction
of the earth, I assent. But by what motion
this is done, hath not as yet been explained by any
man. I shall therefore in this place say somewhat
of the manner and of the way by which the
earth by its action attracteth heavy bodies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The difference of gravities proceedeth from the difference of the impetus with which the elements, whereof heavy bodies are made, do fall upon the earth.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.3'></a>3. That by the supposition of simple motion in
the sun, homogeneous bodies are congregated and
heterogeneous dissipated, has already been demonstrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>in the <a href='#art21.5'>5th article</a> of chapter <span class='fss'>XXI</span>. I have
also supposed, that there are intermingled with the
pure air certain little bodies, or, as others call them,
atoms; which by reason of their extreme smallness
are invisible, and differing from one another
in consistence, figure, motion, and magnitude;
from whence it comes to pass that some of them
are congregated to the earth, others to other
planets, and others are carried up and down in the
spaces between. And seeing those, which are carried
to the earth, differ from one another in figure,
motion, and magnitude, they will fall upon the
earth, some with greater, others with less impetus.
And seeing also that we compute the several
degrees of gravity no otherwise than by this their
falling upon the earth with greater or less impetus;
it follows, that we conclude those to be the more
heavy that have the greater impetus, and those to be
less heavy that have the less impetus. Our inquiry
therefore must be, by what means it may come to
pass, that of bodies, which descend from above to
the earth, some are carried with greater, others
with less impetus; that is to say, some are more
heavy than others. We must also inquire, by what
means such bodies, as settle upon the earth, may
by the earth itself be forced to ascend.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of the descent of heavy bodies.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig30.2'></a><a id='art30.4'></a>4. Let the circle made upon the centre C (in
<a href='#fig30.f2'>fig. 2</a>) be a great circle in the superficies of the
earth, passing through the points A and B. Also
let any heavy body, as the stone A D, be placed
anywhere in the plane of the equator; and let it
be conceived to be cast up from A D perpendicularly,
or to be carried in any other line to E, and
supposed to rest there. Therefore, how much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>space soever the stone took up in A D, so much
space it takes up now in E. And because all place
is supposed to be full, the space A D will be filled
by the air which flows into it first from the nearest
places of the earth, and afterwards successively
from more remote places. Upon the centre C let
a circle be understood to be drawn through E; and
let the plane space, which is between the superficies
of the earth and that circle, be divided into plane
orbs equal and concentric; of which let that be the
first, which is contained by the two perimeters that
pass through A and D. Whilst therefore the air,
which is in the first orb, filleth the place A D, the
orb itself is made so much less, and consequently
its latitude is less than the strait line A D. Wherefore
there will necessarily descend so much air
from the orb next above. In like manner, for the
same cause, there will also be a descent of air from
the orb next above that; and so by succession
from the orb in which the stone is at rest in E.
Either therefore the stone itself, or so much air,
will descend. And seeing air is by the diurnal
revolution of the earth more easily thrust away
than the stone, the air, which is in the orb that
contains the stone, will be forced further upwards
than the stone. But this, without the admission
of vacuum, cannot be, unless so much air descend
to E from the place next above; which being done,
the stone will be thrust downwards. By this
means therefore the stone now receives the beginning
of its descent, that is to say, of its gravity.
Furthermore, whatsoever is once moved, will be
moved continually (as hath been shown in the
<a href='#art8.19'>19th article</a> of chapter <span class='fss'>VIII</span>) in the same way, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>with the same celerity, except it be retarded or
accelerated by some external movent. Now the
air, which is the only body that is interposed between
the earth A and the stone above it E, will
have the same action in every point of the strait
line E A, which it hath in E. But it depressed the
stone in E; and therefore also it will depress it
equally in every point of the strait line E A. Wherefore
the stone will descend from E to A with accelerated
motion. The possible cause therefore of
the descent of heavy bodies under the equator, is
the diurnal motion of the earth. And the same
demonstration will serve, if the stone be placed in
the plane of any other circle parallel to the equator.
But because this motion hath, by reason of its
greater slowness, less force to thrust off the air in
the parallel circles than in the equator, and no
force at all at the poles, it may well be thought
(for it is a certain consequent) that heavy bodies
descend with less and less velocity, as they are
more and more remote from the equator; and that
at the poles themselves, they will either not descend
at all, or not descend by the axis; which whether
it be true or false, experience must determine. But
it is hard to make the experiment, both because
the times of their descents cannot be easily measured
with sufficient exactness, and also because
the places near the poles are inaccessible. Nevertheless,
this we know, that by how much the
nearer we come to the poles, by so much the
greater are the flakes of the snow that falls; and
by how much the more swiftly such bodies descend
as are fluid and dissipable, by so much the smaller
are the particles into which they are dissipated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In what proportion the descent of heavy bodies is accelerated.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span><a id='art30.5'></a>5. Supposing, therefore, this to be the cause of
the descent of heavy bodies, it will follow that
their motion will be accelerated in such manner,
as that the spaces, which are transmitted by them
in the several times, will have to one another the
same proportion which the odd numbers have in
succession from unity. For if the strait line E A
be divided into any number of equal parts, the
heavy body descending will, by reason of the perpetual
action of the diurnal motion, receive from
the air in every one of those times, in every several
point of the strait line E A, a several new and
equal impulsion; and therefore also in every one
of those times, it will acquire a several and equal
degree of celerity. And from hence it follows, by
that which Galileus hath in his <cite>Dialogues of Motion</cite>
demonstrated, that heavy bodies descend in
the several times with such differences of transmitted
spaces, as are equal to the differences of
the square numbers that succeed one another from
unity; which square numbers being 1, 4, 9, 16,
&#38;c. their differences are 3, 5, 7, &#38;c.; that is to say,
the odd numbers which succeed one another from
unity. Against this cause of gravity which I have
given, it will perhaps be objected, that if a heavy
body be placed in the bottom of some hollow
cylinder of iron or adamant, and the bottom be
turned upwards, the body will descend, though the
air above cannot depress it, much less accelerate
its motion. But it is to be considered that there
can be no cylinder or cavern, but such as is supported
by the earth, and being so supported is,
together with the earth, carried about by its
diurnal motion. For by this means the bottom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>the cylinder will be as the superficies of the earth;
and by thrusting off the next and lowest air, will
make the uppermost air depress the heavy body,
which is at the top of the cylinder, in such manner
as is above explicated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Why those that dive, do not, when they are under water, feel the weight of the water above them.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.6'></a>6. The gravity of water being so great as by
experience we find it is, the reason is demanded by
many, why those that dive, how deep soever they
go under water, do not at all feel the weight of
the water which lies upon them. And the cause
seems to be this, that all bodies by how much the
heavier they are, by so much the greater is the
endeavour by which they tend downwards. But
the body of a man is heavier than so much water
as is equal to it in magnitude, and therefore the
endeavour downwards of a man's body is greater
than that of water. And seeing all endeavour is
motion, the body also of a man will be carried
towards the bottom with greater velocity than so
much water. Wherefore there is greater reaction
from the bottom; and the endeavour upwards is
equal to the endeavour downwards, whether the
water be pressed by water, or by another body
which is heavier than water. And therefore by
these two opposite equal endeavours, the endeavour
both ways in the water is taken away; and consequently,
those that dive are not at all pressed
by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coroll. From hence also it is manifest, that
water in water hath no weight at all, because all
the parts of water, both the parts above, and the
parts that are directly under, tend towards the
bottom with equal endeavour and in the same
strait lines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The weight of a body that floateth, is equal to the weight of so much water as would fill the space which the immersed part of the body takes up within the water.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span><a id='art30.7'></a>7. If a body float upon the water, the weight of
that body is equal to the weight of so much water
as would fill the place which the immersed part of
the body takes up within the water.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig30.3'></a>Let E F (in <a href='#fig30.f3'>fig. 3</a>) be a body floating in the water
A B C D; and let the part E be above, and the
other part F under the water. I say, the weight
of the whole body E F is equal to the weight of so
much water as the space F will receive. For
seeing the weight of the body E F forceth the
water out of the space F, and placeth it upon the
superficies A B, where it presseth downwards; it
follows, that from the resistance of the bottom
there will also be an endeavour upwards. And
seeing again, that by this endeavour of the water
upwards, the body E F is lifted up, it follows, that
if the endeavour of the body downwards be not
equal to the endeavour of the water upwards,
either the whole body E F will, by reason of that
inequality of their endeavours or moments, be
raised out of the water, or else it will descend to
the bottom. But it is supposed to stand so, as
neither to ascend nor descend. Wherefore there
is an equilibrium between the two endeavours;
that is to say, the weight of the body E F is equal
to the weight of so much water as the space F will
receive; which was to be proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>If a body be lighter than water, then how big soever that body be, it may float upon any quantity of water, how little soever.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.8'></a>8. From hence it follows, that any body, of how
great magnitude soever, provided it consist of
matter less heavy than water, may nevertheless
float upon any quantity of water, how little soever.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='fig30.4'></a>Let A B C D (in <a href='#fig30.f4'>fig. 4</a>) be a vessel; and in it let
E F G H be a body consisting of matter which is
less heavy than water; and let the space A G C F
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>be filled with water. I say, the body E F G H will
not sink to the bottom D C. For seeing the matter
of the body E F G H is less heavy than water, if the
whole space without A B C D were fall of water,
yet some part of the body E F G H, as E F I K,
would be above the water; and the weight of so
much water as would fill the space I G H K would
be equal to the weight of the whole body E F G H;
and consequently G H would not touch the bottom
D C. As for the sides of the vessel, it is no
matter whether they be hard or fluid; for they
serve only to terminate the water; which may be
done as well by water as by any other matter how
hard soever; and the water without the vessel is
terminated somewhere, so as that it can spread no
farther. The part therefore E F I K will be extant
above the water A G C F which is contained in the
vessel. Wherefore the body E F G H will also
float upon the water A G C F, how little soever
that water be; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How water may be lifted up and forced out of a vessel by air.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.9'></a>9. In the <a href='#art26.4'>4th article</a> of chapter <span class='fss'>XXVI</span>, there is
brought for the proving of vacuum the experiment
of water enclosed in a vessel; which water, the
orifice above being opened, is ejected upwards by
the impulsion of the air. It is therefore demanded,
seeing water is heavier than air, how that can be
done. Let the <a href='#fig26.f2'>second figure</a> of the same, chapter
<span class='fss'>XXVI</span> be considered, where the water is with great
force injected by a syringe into the space F G B.
In that injection, the air (but pure air) goeth
with the same force out of the vessel through the
injected water. But as for those small bodies,
which formerly I supposed to be intermingled with
air and to be moved with simple motion, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>cannot, together with the pure air, penetrate the
water; but remaining behind are necessarily thrust
together into a narrower place, namely into the
space which is above the water F G. The motions
therefore of those small bodies will be less
and less free, by how much the quantity of the
injected water is greater and greater; so that by
their motions falling upon one another, the same
small bodies will mutually compress each other,
and have a perpetual endeavour of regaining their
liberty, and of depressing the water that hinders
them. Wherefore, as soon as the orifice above is
opened, the water which is next it will have an
endeavour to ascend, and will therefore necessarily
go out. But it cannot go out, unless at the same
time there enter in as much air; and therefore
both the water will go out, and the air enter in,
till those small bodies which were left within the
vessel have recovered their former liberty of motion;
that is to say, till the vessel be again filled
with air, and no water be left of sufficient height
to stop the passage at B. Wherefore I have shown
a possible cause of this phenomenon, namely, the
same with that of thunder. For as in the generation
of thunder, the small bodies enclosed within
the clouds, by being too closely pent together, do
by their motion break the clouds, and restore themselves
to their natural liberty; so here also the
small bodies enclosed within the space which is
above the strait line F G, do by their own motion
expel the water as soon as the passage is opened
above. And if the passage be kept stopped, and
these small bodies be more vehemently compressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>by the perpetual forcing in of more water, they
will at last break the vessel itself with great noise.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Why a bladder is heavier when blown full of air, than when it is empty.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.10'></a>10. If air be blown into a hollow cylinder, or
into a bladder, it will increase the weight of either
of them a little, as many have found by experience,
who with great accurateness have tried the same.
And it is no wonder, seeing, as I have supposed,
there are intermingled with the common air a great
number of small hard bodies, which are heavier
than the pure air. For, the ethereal substance,
being on all sides equally agitated by the motion of
the sun, hath an equal endeavour towards all the
parts of the universe; and, therefore, it hath no
gravity at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of the ejection upwards of heavy bodies from a wind-gun.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.11'></a>11. We find also by experience, that, by the
force of air enclosed in a hollow cannon, a bullet
of lead may with considerable violence be shot out
of a gun of late invention, called the wind-gun. In
the end of this cannon there are two holes, with
their valves on the inside, to shut them close; one
of them serving for the admission of air, and the
other for the letting of it out. Also, to that end
which serves for the receiving in of air, there is
joined another cannon of the same metal and bigness,
in which there is fitted a rammer which is
perforated, and hath also a valve opening towards
the former cannon. By the help of this valve the
rammer is easily drawn back, and letteth in air
from without; and being often drawn back and
returned again with violent strokes, it forceth some
part of that air into the former cannon, so long,
till at last the resistance of the enclosed air is
greater than the force of the stroke. And by this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>means men think there is now a greater quantity of
air in the cannon than there was formerly, though
it were full before. Also, the air thus forced in,
how much soever it be, is hindered from getting
out again by the aforesaid valves, which the very
endeavour of the air to get out doth necessarily
shut. Lastly, that valve being opened which was
made for the letting out of the air, it presently
breaketh out with violence, and driveth the bullet
before it with great force and velocity.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the cause of this, I could easily attribute
it, as most men do, to condensation, and think
that the air, which had at the first but its ordinary
degree of rarity, was afterwards, by the forcing in
of more air, condensed, and last of all, rarified
again by being let out and restored to its natural
liberty. But I cannot imagine how the same place
can be always full, and, nevertheless, contain some
times a greater, sometimes a less quantity of matter;
that is to say, that it can be fuller than full. Nor
can I conceive how fulness can of itself be an efficient
cause of motion. For both these are impossible.
Wherefore we must seek out some other
possible cause of this phenomenon. Whilst, therefore,
the valve which serves for the letting in of
air, is opened by the first stroke of the rammer,
the air within doth with equal force resist the entering
of the air from without; so that the endeavours
between the internal and external air are opposite,
that is, there are two opposite motions whilst the
one goeth in and the other cometh out; but no
augmentation at all of air within the cannon. For
there is driven out by the stroke as much pure air,
which passeth between the rammer and the sides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>of the cannon, as there is forced in of air impure by
the same stroke. And thus, by many forcible
strokes, the quantity of small hard bodies will be
increased within the cannon, and their motions also
will grow stronger and stronger, as long as the
matter of the cannon is able to endure their force;
by which, if it be not broken, it will at least be
urged every way by their endeavour to free themselves;
and as soon as the valve, which serves to
let them out, is opened, they will fly out with
violent motion, and carry with them the bullet
which is in their way. Wherefore, I have given
a possible cause of this phenomenon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The cause of the ascent of water in a weather-glass.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.12'></a>12. Water, contrary to the custom of heavy
bodies, ascendeth in the weather-glass; but it doth
it when the air is cold: for when it is warm it descendeth
again. And this organ is called a thermometer
or thermoscope, because the degrees of
heat and cold are measured and marked by it. It is
made in this manner. <a id='fig30.5'></a>Let A B C D (in <a href='#fig30.f5'>fig. 5</a>) be
a vessel full of water, and E F G a hollow cylinder
of glass, closed at E and open at G. Let it be
heated, and set upright within the water to F; and
let the open end reach to G. This being done, as the
air by little and little grows colder, the water will
ascend slowly within the cylinder from F towards
E; till at last the external and internal air coming
to be both of the same temper, it will neither ascend
higher nor descend lower, till the temper of
the air be changed. Suppose it, therefore, to be
settled anywhere, as at H. If now the heat of the
air be augmented, the water will descend below H;
and if the heat be diminished, it will ascend above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>it. Which, though it be certainly known to be
true by experience, the cause, nevertheless, hath
not as yet been discovered.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the <a href='#art28.6'>sixth</a> and <a href='#art28.7'>seventh</a> articles of chapter
<span class='fss'>XXVIII</span>, where I consider the cause of cold, I have
shown, that fluid bodies are made colder by the
pressure of the air, that is to say, by a constant
wind that presseth them. For the same cause it
is, that the superficies of the water is pressed at F;
and having no place, to which it may retire from
this pressure, besides the cavity of the cylinder
between H and E, it is therefore necessarily forced
thither by the cold, and consequently it ascendeth
more or less, according as the cold is more or
less increased. And again, as the heat is more intense
or the cold more remiss, the same water
will be depressed more or less by its own gravity,
that is to say, by the cause of gravity above explicated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cause of motion upwards in living creatures</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.13'></a>13. Also living creatures, though they be heavy,
can by leaping, swimming and flying, raise themselves
to a certain degree of height. But they
cannot do this except they be supported by some
resisting body, as the earth, the water and the air.
For these motions have their beginning from the
contraction, by the help of the muscles, of the body
animate. For to this contraction there succeedeth
a distension of their whole bodies; by which distension,
the earth, the water, or the air, which supporteth
them, is pressed; and from hence, by the
reaction of those pressed bodies, living creatures
acquire an endeavour upwards, but such as by
reason of the gravity of their bodies is presently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>lost again. By this endeavour, therefore, it is, that
living creatures raise themselves up a little way by
leaping, but to no great purpose: but by swimming
and flying they raise themselves to a greater height;
because, before the effect of their endeavour is quite
extinguished by the gravity of their bodies, they
can renew the same endeavour again.</p>

<p class='c001'>That by the power of the soul, without any antecedent
contraction of the muscles or the help of
something to support him, any man can be able to
raise his body upwards, is a childish conceit. For
if it were true, a man might raise himself to what
height he pleased.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>That there is in nature a kind of body heavier than air, which nevertheless is not by sense distinguishable from it.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.14'></a>14. The diaphanous medium, which surrounds
the eye on all sides, is invisible; nor is air to be
seen in air, nor water in water, nor anything but
that which is more opacous. But in the confines
of two diaphanous bodies, one of them may be distinguished
from the other. It is not therefore a
thing so very ridiculous for ordinary people to
think all that space empty, in which we say is air;
it being the work of reason to make us conceive
that the air is anything. For by which of our
senses is it, that we take notice of the air, seeing
we neither see, nor hear, nor taste, nor smell, nor
feel it to be anything? When we feel heat, we do
not impute it to the air, but to the fire: nor do we
say the air is cold, but we ourselves are cold; and
when we feel the wind, we rather think something
is coming, than that any thing is already come.
Also, we do not at all feel the weight of water in
water, much less of air in air. That we come to
know that to be a body, which we call air, it is by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>reasoning; but it is from one reason only, namely,
because it is impossible for remote bodies to work
upon our organs of sense but by the help of
bodies intermediate, without which we could have
no sense of them, till they come to be contiguous.
Wherefore, from the senses alone, without reasoning
from effects, we cannot have sufficient evidence
of the nature of bodies.</p>

<p class='c001'>For there is underground, in some mines of coals,
a certain matter of a middle nature between water
and air, which nevertheless cannot by sense be
distinguished from air; for it is as diaphanous as
the purest air; and, as far as sense can judge,
equally penetrable. But if we look upon the effect,
it is like that of water. For when that matter
breaks out of the earth into one of those pits, it
fills the same either totally or to some degree; and
if a man or fire be then let down in it, it extinguishes
them in almost as little time as water would
do. <a id='fig30.6'></a>But for the better understanding of this phenomenon,
I shall describe the <a href='#fig30.f6'>6th figure</a>. In which
let A B represent the pit of the mine; and let part
thereof, namely C B, be supposed to be filled with
that matter. If now a lighted candle be let down
into it below C, it will as suddenly be extinguished
as if it were thrust into water. Also, if a grate filled
with coals thoroughly kindled and burning never
so brightly, be let down, as soon as ever it is below
C, the fire will begin to grow pale, and shortly
after, losing its light, be extinguished, no otherwise
than if it were quenched in water. But if the grate
be drawn up again presently, whilst the coals are still
very hot, the fire will, by little and little, be kindled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>again, and shine as before. There is, indeed, between
this matter and water this considerable difference,
that it neither wetteth, nor sticketh to such
things as are put down into it, as water doth;
which, by the moisture it leaveth, hindereth the
kindling again of the matter once extinguished.
In like manner, if a man be let down below C, he
will presently fall into a great difficulty of breathing,
and immediately after into a swoon, and die
unless he be suddenly drawn up again. They,
therefore, that go down into these pits, have this
custom, that as soon as ever they feel themselves
sick, they shake the rope by which they were let
down, to signify they are not well, and to the end
that they may speedily be pulled up again. For
if a man be drawn out too late, void of sense and
motion, they dig up a turf, and put his face and
mouth into the fresh earth; by which means,
unless he be quite dead, he comes to himself again,
by little and little, and recovers life by breathing
out, as it were, of that suffocating matter, which he
had sucked in whilst he was in the pit; almost in
the same manner as they that are drowned come
to themselves again by vomiting up the water. But
this doth not happen in all mines, but in some only;
and in those not always, but often. In such pits
as are subject to it, they use this remedy. They
dig another pit, as D E, close by it, of equal depth,
and joining them both together with one common
channel, E B, they make a fire in the bottom E,
which carries out at D the air contained in the pit
D E; and this draws with it the air contained in
the channel E B; which, in like manner, is followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>by the noxious matter contained in C B; and,
by this means, the pit is for that time made healthful.
Out of this history, which I write only to
such as have had experience of the truth of it,
without any design to support my philosophy with
stories of doubtful credit, may be collected the following
possible cause of this phenomenon; namely,
that there is a certain matter fluid and most transparent,
and not much lighter than water, which,
breaking out of the earth, fills the pit to C; and
that in this matter, as in water, both fire and
living creatures are extinguished.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of the cause of magnetical virtue.</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='art30.15'></a>15. About the nature of heavy bodies, the greatest
difficulty ariseth from the contemplation of those
things which make other heavy bodies ascend to
them; such as jet, amber, and the loadstone. But
that which troubles men most is the loadstone,
which is also called <span lang="la"><i>Lapis Herculeus</i></span>; a stone,
though otherwise despicable, yet of so great power
that it taketh up iron from the earth, and holds it
suspended in the air, as Hercules did Antæus.
Nevertheless, we wonder at it somewhat the less,
because we see jet draw up straws, which are heavy
bodies, though not so heavy as iron. But as for
jet, it must first be excited by rubbing, that is to
say, by motion to and fro; whereas the loadstone
hath sufficient excitation from its own nature, that
is to say, from some internal principle of motion
peculiar to itself. Now, whatsoever is moved, is
moved by some contiguous and moved body, as
hath been formerly demonstrated. And from hence
it follows evidently, that the first endeavour, which
iron hath towards the loadstone, is caused by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>motion of that air which is contiguous to the iron:
also, that this motion is generated by the motion of
the next air, and so on successively, till by this
succession we find that the motion of all the intermediate
air taketh its beginning from some motion
which is in the loadstone itself; which motion,
because the loadstone seems to be at rest, is invisible.
It is therefore certain, that the attractive
power of the loadstone is nothing else but some
motion of the smallest particles thereof. Supposing,
therefore, that those small bodies, of which
the loadstone is in the bowels of the earth composed,
have by nature such motion or endeavour
as was above attributed to jet, namely, a reciprocal
motion in a line too short to be seen, both those
stones will have one and the same cause of attraction.
Now in what manner and in what order of
working this cause produceth the effect of attraction,
is the thing to be enquired. And first we
know, that when the string of a lute or viol is
stricken, the vibration, that is, the reciprocal motion
of that string in the same strait line, causeth
like vibration in another string which hath like
tension. We know also, that the dregs or small
sands, which sink to the bottom of a vessel, will
be raised up from the bottom by any strong and
reciprocal agitation of the water, stirred with the
hand or with a staff. Why, therefore, should not
reciprocal motion of the parts of the loadstone contribute
as much towards the moving of iron? For,
if in the loadstone there be supposed such reciprocal
motion, or motion of the parts forwards and backwards,
it will follow that the like motion will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>propagated by the air to the iron, and consequently
that there will be in all the parts of the iron the
same reciprocations or motions forwards and backwards.
And from hence also it will follow, that
the intermediate air between the stone and the
iron will, by little and little, be thrust away; and
the air being thrust away, the bodies of the loadstone
and the iron will necessarily come together.
The possible cause therefore why the loadstone
and jet draw to them, the one iron, the other
straws, may be this, that those attracting bodies
have reciprocal motion either in a strait line, or in
an elliptical line, when there is nothing in the nature
of the attracted bodies which is repugnant to
such a motion.</p>

<p class='c001'>But why the loadstone, if with the help of cork
it float at liberty upon the top of the water, should
from any position whatsoever so place itself in the
plane of the meridian, as that the same points,
which at one time of its being at rest respect the
poles of the earth, should at all other times respect
the same poles, the cause may be this; that the reciprocal
motion, which I supposed to be in the parts
of the stone, is made in a line parallel to the axis
of the earth, and has been in those parts ever since
the stone was generated. Seeing therefore, the
stone, whilst it remains in the mine, and is carried
about together with the earth by its diurnal motion,
doth by length of time get a habit of being
moved in a line which is perpendicular to the line
of its reciprocal motion, it will afterwards, though
its axis be removed from the parallel situation it
had with the axis of the earth, retain its endeavour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>of returning to that situation again; and all endeavour
being the beginning of motion, and nothing
intervening that may hinder the same, the loadstone
will therefore return to its former situation.
For, any piece of iron that has for a long time rested
in the plane of the meridian, whensoever it is forced
from that situation and afterwards left to its own
liberty again, will of itself return to lie in the
meridian again; which return is caused by the
endeavour it acquired from the diurnal motion of
the earth in the parallel circles which are perpendicular
to the meridians.</p>

<p class='c001'>If iron be rubbed by the loadstone drawn from
one pole to the other, two things will happen; one,
that the iron will acquire the same direction with
the loadstone, that is to say, that it will lie in the
meridian, and have its axis and poles in the same
position with those of the stone; the other, that
the like poles of the stone and of the iron will
avoid one another, and the unlike poles approach
one another. And the cause of the former may be
this, that iron being touched by motion which is
not reciprocal, but drawn the same way from pole
to pole, there will be imprinted in the iron also an
endeavour from the same pole to the same pole.
For seeing the loadstone differs from iron no otherwise
than as ore from metal, there will be no
repugnance at all in the iron to receive the same
motion which is in the stone. From whence it
follows, that seeing they are both affected alike by
the diurnal motion of the earth, they will both
equally return to their situation in the meridian,
whensoever they are put from the same. Also, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>the latter this may be the cause, that as the loadstone
in touching the iron doth by its action imprint
in the iron an endeavour towards one of the
poles, suppose towards the North Pole; so reciprocally,
the iron by its action upon the loadstone
doth imprint in it an endeavour towards the other
pole, namely towards the South Pole. It happens
therefore in these reciprocations or motions forwards
and backwards of the particles of the stone
and of the iron betwixt the north and the south,
that whilst in one of them the motion is from north
to south, and the return from south to north, in
the other the motion will be from south to north,
and the return from north to south; which motions
being opposite to one another, and communicated
to the air, the north pole of the iron, whilst the
attraction is working, will be depressed towards
the south pole of the loadstone; or contrarily, the
north pole of the loadstone will be depressed
towards the south pole of the iron; and the axis
both of the loadstone and of the iron will be situate
in the same strait line. The truth whereof is
taught us by experience.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the propagation of this magnetical virtue,
not only through the air, but through any other
bodies how hard soever, it is not to be wondered
at, seeing no motion can be so weak, but that it
may be propagated infinitely through a space filled
with body of any hardness whatsoever. For in a
full medium, there can be no motion which doth
not make the next part yield, and that the next,
and so successively without end; so that there is
no effect whatsoever, but to the production thereof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>something is necessarily contributed by the several
motions of all the several things that are in the
world.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Conclusion.</div>

<p class='c001'>And thus much concerning the nature of body
in general; with which I conclude this my first
section of the Elements of Philosophy. In the
first, second, and third parts, where the principles
of ratiocination consist in our own understanding,
that is to say, in the legitimate use of such words
as we ourselves constitute, all the theorems, if I be
not deceived, are rightly demonstrated. The fourth
part depends upon hypotheses; which unless we
know them to be true, it is impossible for us to
demonstrate that those causes, which I have there
explicated, are the true causes of the things whose
productions I have derived from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, seeing I have assumed no hypothesis,
which is not both possible and easy to be
comprehended; and seeing also that I have reasoned
aright from those assumptions, I have withal
sufficiently demonstrated that they may be the true
causes; which is the end of physical contemplation.
If any other man from other hypotheses
shall demonstrate the same or greater things,
there will be greater praise and thanks due to him
than I demand for myself, provided his hypotheses
be such as are conceivable. For as for those that
say anything may be moved or produced by <em>itself</em>,
by <em>species</em>, by <em>its own power</em>, by <em>substantial forms</em>,
by <em>incorporeal substances</em>, by <em>instinct</em>, by <em>antiperistasis</em>,
by <em>antipathy</em>, <em>sympathy</em>, <em>occult quality</em>,
and other empty words of schoolmen, their saying
so is to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>And now I proceed to the phenomena of man's
body; where I shall speak of the <em>optics</em>, and of
the <em>dispositions</em>, <em>affections</em>, and <em>manners</em> of men,
if it shall please God to give me life, and show
their causes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chapters 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28&#38;30
were provided with a full page of figures (except Chapter 23,
which included four illustrations, and the illustrations for Chapters
28 and 30, which are combined). Each large illustration (except those
for Chapter 20, which were deemed large enough) consists
of smaller figures, which are discussed in the text. The
illustrations have been placed at the end of a chapter, and
each figure is linked to a more isolated image, found at the end of the
Transcriber's Notes. The captions in those detail figures
are linked back to their first mention in the text. (Aspects
of some are discussed in multiple places.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Figures 18.2 and 27.2 are not mentioned by name in
the text. Figure 14.10 is mentioned only in Chapter XIII.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, <a href='#fig18.f2'>Figure 2</a> of Chapter XVIII would appear
to be the subject of a discussion on p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>. A sidenote
has been added, and includes a reference to the figure.</p>

<p class='c001'>Likewise <a href='#fig27.f2'>Figure 2</a> of Chapter XXVII, depicting a
‘prisma’, is discussed in detail on p. <a href='#Page_459'>459</a> <i>et seq.</i>.
Again, a sidenote has been interpolated at the opening of
that description, and includes a reference to the figure.</p>

<p class='c001'>The diacritics used in the Greek phrases is followed as printed,
though they sometimes seem non-standard (i.e., εἰναι rather than
ειναὶ).</p>

<p class='c001'>In each chapter's summary, the article numbers are prefixed with a dash
if they appeared midline. Dashes have been added to the text in the
case where the article number happened to appear in the first
column.</p>

<p class='c001'>On rare occasions, there are errors in the numbering of the
articles in the chapter summary. For example, in Chapter XVII,
article 7 was misnumbered as a second ‘6’.</p>

<p class='c001'>In article 18 of Chapter XIII, a reference to article 10 of
that chapter used the Roman ‘<span class='fss'>X</span>’ which is the only
instance of that usage. It is now referred to as article 10.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>
